TermLayout
==========

TermLayout is a text-mode HTML formatter for Unix terminals which supports:

* Ruby markup (multiple rt and rb elements are stacked)

* Tables (including nesting and alignment)

* Wide characters (uses locale settings from LC_CTYPE, LANG etc)

* Smaller terminal sizes. In some cases a table will still end up being wider than the terminal and not easily reﬂowable; if that happens then at least each cell should fit. But in many cases TermLayout can arrange for no horizontal scrolling to be necessary.

Unrecognised markup is left in the output for inspection.

TermLayout is _not_ a Web browser: it has no facilities for navigating links. It is meant only for formatting text on a terminal using HTML markup. I wrote it when I wanted to page through a document with Ruby markup in fbterm but couldn’t find a text-mode browser that would format this markup correctly.

If you are using TermLayout with an annotator generated by Annotator Generator, you might also be interested in `tmux-annotator.sh` which sets up tmux with a “hotkey” to annotate the current screen and display the result in TermLayout.
