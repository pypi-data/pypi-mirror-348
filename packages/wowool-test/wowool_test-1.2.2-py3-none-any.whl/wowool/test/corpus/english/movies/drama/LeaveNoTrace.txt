Title: Leave No Trace

Will, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD, lives with his 13-year-old daughter, Tom, in a public park inside Portland, Oregon. They live in isolation, only entering town occasionally for food and supplies. Will makes their money by selling his VA-issued painkillers to other veterans.

After Tom is spotted in the woods by a jogger, officers arrest them and place them into social services. They are given food and a house on a Christmas tree farm in rural Oregon, on the condition that Will abides by the rules of the home owner and social services. Will begrudgingly begins work packaging trees, but is traumatized by the helicopters used to move them. Tom connects with a boy who is building his own tiny house, and he introduces her to his 4H club. After they leave Will tells Tom they would have been separated if they didn’t conform. She follows reluctantly.

Will and Tom catch a ride north with a long-haul trucker to the edge of trackless woods. They bushwhack in a direction Will expects to lead to an unoccupied cabin, but cold and darkness force them to build a makeshift tent to survive the night. The next day, they find a vacant cabin and move in.

Will leaves to find food but does not return before dark. The next morning, Tom searches for Will and discovers him unconscious at the bottom of a hill. She gets help from locals, who take them to their mobile home community. Will refuses to be taken to a hospital. A local woman calls a friend of hers, a former Army medic (and fellow PTSD sufferer), who treats Will's leg and lends him his service dog.

Will and Tom stay in the community while Will’s injuries heal. Tom likes their new home, but eventually Will insists they leave. Tom protests, telling him "the same thing that’s wrong with you isn't wrong with me." While leaving the community in the forest, Tom stops, as her father realizes she can no longer live the life he wants to. They tearfully hug, and part ways. Tom returns to the community, and Will returns to the woods.
