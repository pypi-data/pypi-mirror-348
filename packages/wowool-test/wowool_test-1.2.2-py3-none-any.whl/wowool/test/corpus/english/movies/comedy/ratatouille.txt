Title: Ratatouille

Remy is an idealistic and ambitious young rat with highly developed senses of taste and smell who dreams of becoming a chef like his idol, the recently deceased Auguste Gusteau. One day when his family are forced to flee their home, Remy becomes separated and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant in Paris.

He sees garbage boy Alfredo Linguini spill a pot of soup and attempt to recreate it. Remy sees that he is ruining it and fixes his mistakes, which Linguini witnesses. Skinner, Gusteau's former sous-chef and new owner, confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but while they argue the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. Skinner retains Linguini who is assumed to be the soup's creator, and orders him to kill the rat. Instead, Linguini hides Remy under his toque where Remy guides Linguini like a marionette by pulling on his hair. Skinner assigns the female chef Colette to train his new cook.

Skinner and Remy learn that Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate son and the rightful owner of the restaurant. Remy gives the evidence to Linguini, forcing Skinner to step down as owner. The restaurant thrives, Remy's recipes become popular, and a romance develops between Linguini and Colette causing Remy to feel left out. He visits his clan in their new lair but Remy and his father Django fall out over his admiration for humans and Remy leaves.

Meanwhile, the evil world-renowned food critic Anton Ego, whose negative review precipitated Gusteau's death, announces he will dine at the restaurant. After getting into a heated argument with Linguini, Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant's pantries in revenge, but Linguini drives them out. Remy is then captured by Skinner, but freed by Django and his gluttonous older brother, Emile, who eats food whole, rather than savor the flavor. Linguini apologizes to Remy, having been unable to cook without him, and reveals the truth to the staff who leave in disgust. Colette returns, recalling Gusteau's motto, "Anyone can cook."

Impressed by Remy's determination, Django and the clan offer to help. The rats cook while Linguini waits tables. Remy creates a ratatouille variation, confit byaldi, which reminds Ego of his mother's cooking. The rats tie up Skinner and a health inspector to prevent them revealing that rats are cooking, and when Ego requests to see the chef, Linguini and Colette make him wait until the other diners have left before introducing Remy. Ego is stunned and writes a glowing review, saying he now truly understands Gusteau's famous motto and calling Remy "nothing less than the finest chef in France."

However, Gusteau's is permanently closed due to the presence of rats violating health regulations and Ego loses his job and his credibility as a critic. He then funds and frequents a popular new bistro, La Ratatouille, created and run by Remy, Linguini, and Colette, and the rats settle into their new home on the bistro's roof.
