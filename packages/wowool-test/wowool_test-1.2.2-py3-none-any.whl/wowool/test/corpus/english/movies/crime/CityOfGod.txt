Title: City Of God

Chickens are being prepared for a meal. A chicken escapes, and an armed gang chases after it in a favela called the Cidade de Deus ("City of God"). The chicken stops between the gang and a young man named Rocket (Buscapé), who believes the gang wants to kill him. A flashback traces Rocket, the narrator, back to the late 1960s.

In the 1960s, the favela is a newly built housing project far from the centre of Rio de Janeiro, with little access to electricity and water. Three impoverished, amateur thieves known as the "Tender Trio" – Shaggy, Clipper, and Goose – rob and loot business owners; Goose is Rocket's brother. The thieves split part of the loot with the citizens of the City and are protected by them in return. Several younger boys idolize the trio, and one, Li'l Dice (Dadinho), convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. The gang resolves not to kill anyone and tells Li'l Dice to serve as lookout. They give him a gun and tell him to fire a warning shot if the police arrive, but an unsatisfied Li'l Dice fires a warning shot mid-robbery and guns down the motel inhabitants once the gang have run off. The massacre brings police attention, forcing the trio to split up: Clipper joins the church, Shaggy is shot by the police while trying to escape the favela, and Goose is shot by Li'l Dice after taking the thieving boy's money while Li'l Dice's friend Benny (Bené),who is Shaggy's brother, watches.

Some years later in the 1970s, the favela has transformed into an urban jungle. Rocket has joined a group of young hippies. He enjoys photography and likes one girl, Angelica, but his attempts to get close to her are ruined by a gang of petty criminal kids known as "The Runts". Li'l Dice now calls himself "Li'l Zé" ("Zé Pequeno"), and along with Benny he has established a drug empire by eliminating all of the competition, except for one dealer named Carrot who is a good friend of Benny's and such Benny convinces Lil Zé not to go after him.However Lil Zé takes over 'the apartment' and forces Carrot's manager Blackie (Neguinho) to work for him instead.Inconsequently while the apartment raid, Rocket is visiting the apartment to get some drugs off Blacky (who is a old classmate of Rocket's) and is caught in the middle of the raid. As narrated, he momentarily considers attempting to kill Lil Zé and avenge his brother but decides against it.He is let go after Benny convinces Lil Zé to with the both acknowledging,rather gleefully, that Rocket is Goose's brother.

Benny would later decide to get out away from the drug dealer crowd, convincing one of the members of the Groovy crowd, Tiago (who was formerly Angelica's boyfriend) to get him some new clothes. Benny would later be introduced into the Groovie's crew creating a evident infatuation with Angelica much to the displeasure of Rocket.

A relative peace has come over the City of God under the reign of Li'l Zé, who avoids police attention by having an initiate kill a Runt after a small group of them rob a store in Zé's territory (something he warned Carrot previously to tell his grunts not to do). Zé plans to kill Carrot, but Benny talks him out of it. Benny, who is now involved with Angelica, decides to leave the City. During the farewell party, Zé is distracted, and Blackie accidentally kills Benny while trying to shoot Li'l Zé. As Benny was the only man holding Zé back from taking over Carrot's business, his death leaves Zé unchecked, and Carrot kills Blackie for endangering his life.

Following Benny's death, Lil Zé and a handful of his soldiers proceed to make their way to Carrot's hideout with the intention of killing him once and for all. While en route he stops to attempt to hit on a girl who dismisses him. Zé follows the girl and beats up her boyfriend, a peaceful man named Knockout Ned (Mane Galinha) and rapes her. After Ned's brother stabs Zé, his gang retaliates by killing his brother and firing on Ned's house and killing his uncle. Ned, looking for revenge, sides with Carrot, and a war breaks out between Carrot and Zé.

In the early 1980s, both sides enlist more "soldiers". Zé provides weapons for the Runts, and eventually the reason for the war is forgotten. One day, Zé has Rocket take photos of him and his gang. After Rocket leaves his film with a friend who works at a newspaper office downtown, a female reporter publishes one of the prints, a major scoop since nobody can get into the City of God anymore. Rocket believes his life is endangered, as he thinks Ze will kill him if he returns to the favela; the reporter takes him in for the night, and he loses his virginity to her. However unbeknowest to him, Lil Zé expresses growing pleasure in his name finally being thrown out there as be believes now people will finally know who he is.

Rocket agrees to continue taking photographs, not realizing Zé is very pleased with increased notoriety. Rocket returns to the City for more photographs, bringing the film back to the opening scene. Confronted by the gang, Rocket is surprised that Zé asks him to take pictures, but as he prepares to take the photo, the police arrive, and then drive off when Carrot arrives. In the gunfight, Ned is killed by a boy who has infiltrated his gang to avenge his father: a security guard who was killed by Ned during a bank robbery. The police capture Li'l Zé and Carrot, planning to give the media Carrot, whose gang never paid off the police, while they steal Zé's money and let him go. Rocket secretly photographs the scene. Zé is murdered by the Runts who intend to run the criminal enterprise themselves as well as kill Zé out of revenge for the runt that Lil Zè had one of his initiates kill. Rocket photographs Zé's dead body and brings both pictures back to the newspaper.

Rocket contemplates whether to publish the photo of the cops, exposing corruption and becoming famous, or the photo of Li'l Zé's body, which will get him an internship at the newspaper. He decides on the latter and the film ends with the Runts walking around the City of God, making a hit list of the dealers they plan to kill to take over the drug business, including the Red Brigade.
