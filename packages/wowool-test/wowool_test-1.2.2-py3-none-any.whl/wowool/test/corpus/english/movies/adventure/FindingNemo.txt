Title: Finding Nemo

Nemo is a young and cheerful clownfish who lives happily with his father, Marlin in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and is eager to explore life around the ocean, but Marlin appears to be too overprotective of him, due to a barracuda attack that killed his wife Coral and his clutch of eggs. On the first day of school, Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a field trip. When Marlin talks to the teacher, Mr. Ray, Nemo sneaks away from the reef and is captured by a scuba diver, who puts him on a boat. Marlin chases after it and meets Dory, a blue tang who suffers from short term memory loss. The pair encounter three sharks named Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. While at their meeting, Marlin sees the diver's mask that fell from the boat that took Nemo and also sees strange writing on it. However, Marlin and Dory fight over the mask, giving Dory a nose bleed. The blood sends Bruce into a feeding frenzy, and attacks Marlin and Dory, who narrowly escape.

Meanwhile, Nemo is placed in an aquarium in a dentist's office, where he meets the Tank Gang, including yellow tang Bubbles, sea star Peach, cleaner shrimp Jacques, blowfish Bloat, royal gramma Gurgle, and blue and white humbug Deb, led by Gill, a Moorish idol. That night, Nemo learns he is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who has killed previous fish given to her, including a goldfish named Chuckles. Gill devises a plan to escape by having a random fish in the aquarium jam the aquarium's filter with a pebble so the dentist will have to put the fish into plastic bags while the tank gets cleaned, then roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo volunteers to do it, and Gill lets him do it. Nemo attempts to jam the filter but fails, and everybody saves him.

The mask falls into a trench in the deep sea, where Dory reads the address as "P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney". She remembers it despite her short term memory loss. Dory and Marlin receive directions from a school of moonfish. They are supposed to swim through a trench, but they end swimming over it, where they encounter a forest of jellyfish that almost stings them, but they remain okay. Marlin and Dory find themselves on the East Australian Current and have a good time with Crush, a green sea turtle, his son, Squirt, and all the turtles there. Marlin tells the story of his journey to the turtles, who are impressed. News of his quest spreads across the ocean. A pelican named Nigel flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's efforts to find Nemo, who makes another attempt to jam the filter, and succeeds get the aquarium covered in green algae.

Marlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are engulfed by a blue whale. Dory communicates with the whale, who carries them to Sydney Harbor and expels them through his blowhole. There, they meet Nigel the pelican, who help the pair escape from a group of seagulls and takes them to the dentist's office. Meanwhile, the dentist has installed a new high-tech filter and the Tank Gang fail to escape. Darla arrives, and the dentist hands Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel arrives, terrifying Darla and throwing the office into chaos. After the dentist throws Nigel out, Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain that leads to the ocean.

Thinking that Nemo is dead, Marlin abandons Dory and goes home, causing her to forget. However, she meets Nemo when he reaches the ocean, but has lost her memory. Dory's memory returns when she reads the word Sydney on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but is caught in a net with a school of grouper. Nemo enters the net and orders the fish to swim down in order to break the net and they escape. After returning home to the reef, Marlin and Dory watch Mr Ray take Nemo and his friends on a field trip.

Meanwhile, the dentist's new filter breaks down, and the Tank Gang escape unnoticed into Sydney Harbour.
