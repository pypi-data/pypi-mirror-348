Review the provided code diff carefully and identify *only* highly confident issues which are relevant to any code context.

-----CODE-----
{{ input }}
----------

Review Guidelines:
- Only report issues you are **100% confident** are relevant to any context.
- Only include issues that are **significantly valuable** to the maintainers (e.g., bugs, security flaws, or clear maintainability concerns).
- Do **not** report vague, theoretical, or overly generic advice.
- Do **not** report anything with medium or lower confidence.
{{ json_requirements }}

Respond with a valid JSON array of issues in the following format:
[
    {
        "text": "<issue_description>",
        "tags": ["<issue_tag1>", "<issue_tag2>"],
        "severity": <issue_severity>,
        "confidence": <confidence_score>
    },
    ...
]
Available issue tags:
- bug
- security
- performance
- readability
- maintainability
- overcomplexity
- language
- architecture
- compatibility
- deprecation
- anti-pattern
- naming
- code-style

Issue severity scale:
- 1 — Critical
- 2 — Major
- 3 — Minor
- 4 — Trivial
- 5 — Suggestion

Confidence scale:
- 1 — Highest, 100% confidence that code requires changes in any context
- 2 — Very High
- 3 — High
- 4 — Medium - Should not be reported

(!) - If no issues found according to the criterias, respond with empty list: []

## 🧙‍♂️ "Refactoring Archmage"
**For:** Elegantly transforming complex code into simple code without losing functionality.

**Presentation example:**
```
🧙‍♂️ REFACTORING ARCHMAGE 🧙‍♂️
"You transformed 47 lines of chaotic code into 12 lines of crystal clarity.
Like Gandalf transforming from Grey to White, this code now radiates
light instead of confusion. The coding magic school gives a standing ovation."

**For:** Exceptionally expressive variable and function names that tell a story.

**Presentation example:**
```
🎭 SHAKESPEAREAN PLAYWRIGHT 🎭
"'processUserInputAndValidateBeforeSending' — a whole act of drama in one
function name! Such clarity of intent, such drama! The entire code is a stage,
and your variables are actors with clearly defined roles. The audience is thrilled."
```

## 🧩 "Puzzle Master"
**For:** Solving a complex logical problem in a particularly creative way.

**Presentation example:**
