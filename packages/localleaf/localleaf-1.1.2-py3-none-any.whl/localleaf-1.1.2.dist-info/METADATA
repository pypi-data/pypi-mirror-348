# LocalLeaf

This tool provides an easy way to synchronize Overleaf projects from and to your local computer. No paid account necessary.

## Features
- Sync your locally modified `.tex` (and other) files to your Overleaf projects
- Sync your remotely modified `.tex` (and other) files to computer
- Works with free Overleaf account
- No Git or Dropbox required
- Does not steal or store your login credentials (works with a persisted cookie, logging in is done on the original Overleaf website)

## How To Use
### Install
The package is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/localleaf/). Just run:

```
pip3 install localleaf
```

That's it! Depending on your local Python installation, you might need to use `pip` instead of `pip3`.

### Prerequisites
- Create your project on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project), for example a project named `test`. localleaf is not able to create projects (yet).
- Create a folder, preferably with the same name as the project (`test`) on your computer.
- Execute the script from that folder (`test`).
- If you do not specify the project name, localleaf uses the current folder's name as the project name.

### Usage
#### Login
```
lleaf [--cookie-path -v/--verbose] login
```

Logging in will be handled by a mini web browser opening on your device (using Qt5). You can then enter your username and password securely on the official Overleaf website. You might get asked to solve a CAPTCHA in the process. Your credentials are sent to Overleaf over HTTPS.

It then stores your *cookie* (**not** your login credentials) in a hidden file called `.olauth` in your system configuration directory. It is possible to store the cookie elsewhere using the `--cookie-path` option. The cookie file will not be synced to or from Overleaf.

Keep the `.olauth` file save, as it can be used to log in into your account.

### Listing all projects
```
lleaf [--cookie-path -v/--verbose] list
```

Use `lleaf list` to conveniently list all projects in your account available for syncing. 

### Downloading project's PDF
```
lleaf [--cookie-path -v/--verbose] download [-n/--name --download-path]
```

Use `lleaf download` to compile and download your project's PDF. Specify a download path if you do not want to store the PDF file in the current folder. Currently only downloads the first PDF file it finds. Using the `-n/--name` option allows you to specify a different Overleaf project name than the name of the folder you're calling `lleaf` from.

### Pulling and pushing changes
```
lleaf [--cookie-path -v/--verbose] pull [-n/--name -p/--path -i/--olignore]
```

```
lleaf [--cookie-path -v/--verbose] push [-n/--name -p/--path -i/--olignore]
```

Use `lleaf pull` to pull your Overleaf project files to your local project and `lleaf push` to push your local project files to your Overleaf project. When there are changes both locally, and remotely you will be asked which file to keep. If a file has been deleted on the source it can either be deleted on the target as well, restored on the source or ignored.

The `-n/--name` option allows you to specify a different Overleaf project name than the name of the folder you're calling `lleaf` from. The `-p/--path` option allows you to specify a different sync folder than the one you're calling `lleaf` from. The `-i/--olignore` option allows you to specify the path of an `.olignore` file. It uses `fnmatch` internally, so it may have some similarity to `.gitignore` but doesn't work exactly the same. For example, if you wish to exclude a specific folder named `out`, you need to specify it as `out/*`. See [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) for more information.

## Known Bugs
- When modifying a file on Overleaf and immediately syncing afterwards, the tool might not detect the changes. Please allow 1-2 minutes after modifying a file on Overleaf before syncing it to your local computer.
