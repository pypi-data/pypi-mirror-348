# Default Models and Fields

### Base Models

Use provided models as base  models for applications

Always call super class when overriding model methods to preserve activity loggers and parcel history tracking system


### Read only fields

These models provide at least one read only field that reserves encoded data for the model. Parcels cannot be edited, and if edited, the trace must be kept intact
