- Additional meshing setup control with `remeshing_on` and `mesh_present`
- `track_results` property to choose which results from the hdf file to track.
- Getter functions for hdf and sensor array results.

### Changed

- Running simulations in parallel does not do an initial mesh generation if `remeshing_on = False`.

### Removed

- `init_params` that needed to be passed to the `pyCFS` constructor, it is no longer used.

### Fixed

- Data module import.

## [0.0.2] - 2024-03-18

### Added

- `pyCFS.data` package
    - code, tests and doc
- Sensor array result support
    - Because CFS currently does not write SA results into the `hdf` file

### Changed

- Extended dependencies to accommodate `pyCFS.data` package

## [0.0.1] - 2024-03-12

### Added

- Old `pycfs` package code (refactored)
- CI pipeline for automated testing

- Type hints

### Removed

- History results are no longer supported
    - These are now to be written into the `hdf` file

    - When CFS can directly write these to the `hdf` file this package will change accordingly
    - Users should not see much difference in behavior
