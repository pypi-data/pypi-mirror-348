# Additional Information Template

This file is used to provide supplementary information when generating MCP service code, such as special requirements, notes, business logic explanations, etc.

By default, this template is empty and specific supplementary information can be added as needed.

## Examples of Supplementary Information

You can add any additional information here, such as:

- Specific business rules
- Special processing logic
- Data format requirements
- Error handling strategies
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization tips

## Usage

In the prompt template, this content will replace the {{additional_info}} placeholder. If no supplementary information is provided, the generator will replace the placeholder with an empty string.
