Welcome to HySOM's documentation
===========================================================

This is the documentation for the **HySOM** Python package. **HySOM** provides tools for analyzing 2D time series data using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). This package is tailored for studying concentration - discharge hysteresis loops, although any 2D time series can be used.  

The source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/ArlexMR/HySOM>`_

On this documentation page, you’ll find a quickstart guide with instructions on installation and usage of the package, including sample data. We’ve also written tutorials that walk you through using the General T-Q SOM and training standard SOM for C-Q hysteresis analysis.
