# HySOM

**Fast, lightweight Python library for training Self-Organizing Maps on 2D time series, tailored for analyzing concentration-discharge hysteresis loops.**


## 🚀 Overview

**HySOM** is a Python library that simplifies the training and visualization of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for 2D time series. It is specifically designed for the study of concentration–discharge (C–Q) hysteresis loops. With **HySOM**, you can access the **General T-Q SOM**—a standard framework for classifying sediment transport hysteresis loops. The library also includes several visualization tools to streamline the analysis of sediment transport hysteresis loops. Additionally, **HySOM** allows you to train your own SOM for C–Q analysis.
