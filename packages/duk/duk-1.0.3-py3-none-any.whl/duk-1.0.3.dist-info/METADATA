Introduction
============

Duk is a commandline utility that wraps around the linux 'du -ks' command.
It will show you a histogram of the disk usage in a directory:

```bash

Installation                                                                     
============

The easiest way to install duk is to use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io)             

```bash                                                                          
pip install duk                                                                 
```          

In case you're not in a python virtualenv, or don't have administrator access on your computer, you could use:

```bash                                                                          
pip install --user duk                                                                 
```
