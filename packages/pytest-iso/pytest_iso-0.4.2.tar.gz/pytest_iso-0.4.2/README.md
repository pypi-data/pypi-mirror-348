## Features

- Automatically generates a PDF report (`test_protocol.pdf`) from pytest results
- Rust-powered performance
- Seamless integration with `pytest`
- Well suited for creating auditâ€‘ready or compliance documentation

This project is under active development. Expect breaking changes and incomplete features. See [Known Issues](#known-issues)
for further information.

## Use cases

Many projects require verifiable, human-readable test documentation. `pytest-iso` bridges automated testing with audit-ready PDF reports, making it ideal for:

- ISO 27001 or ISO 9001 software audits
- Certification processes
- Offline archiving of test evidence

**Disclaimer:** `pytest-iso` is not officially certified or endorsed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 
Please confirm that its reports meet your specific compliance requirements before use.

## Installation

Pytest-iso supports Python >= 3.9. `Pytest` will automatically detect the plugin via the pytest-entrypoint provided by `pytest-iso`.

```bash
pip install pytest-iso
```

## Usage

Pytest-iso will automatically execute after execution of pytest. 

```bash
pytest tests
```

As a result a PDF file (`test_protocol.pdf`) will be produced in the root directory.

```bash

Generated PDF report: test_protocol.pdf
```

As part of a CI stage, the resulting `test_protocol.pdf` can be pushed to the artifacts:

```bash
#.gitlab-ci.yml
test_py:
  stage: test_py
  image: python:3.13
  before_script:
    - pip install pytest pytest-iso
  script:
    - pytest -s tests
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - test_protocol.pdf
```

An example PDF file can be found under `examples/test_protocol.pdf`.

## Known issues

- PDF layout is still minimal and not "audit-ready" (e.g., needs signature field)
- Layout is currently not customizable (e.g., which sections to print or option to add a company logo)
- Currently, pre-built wheels are only provided for Linux platforms
