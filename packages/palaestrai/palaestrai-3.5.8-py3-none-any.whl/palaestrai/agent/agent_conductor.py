        Each agent, which is represented by an individual conductor,

        The agent conductor allocates the port for the brain-muscle
        interconnection. For this, it binds to a random port given from the OS.
        It passes the port to the brain and closes the socket; the Brain will
        then re-open the socket as ZMQ socket. That works because sockets are
        refcounted and the ref count goes to 0 when the ::`Brain` closes the
        socket before re-opening it. The agent conductor then uses the port
        number (not the socket itself) to pass it to the ::`Muscle` objects,
