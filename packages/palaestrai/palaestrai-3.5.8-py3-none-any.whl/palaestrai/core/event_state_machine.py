class EventStateMachine:
    """An event-triggered state machine

    The EventStateMachine (ESM) can be used to transparently handle events
    within palaestrAI. An ESM wraps another class and callbacks can be defined
    with method decorators for events. Events are:

    * A message received,
    * a signal received (SIGCHLD, SIGTERM, etc.)
    * setup
    * enter (the initial event)
    * teardown

    The initial event *enter* is issued immediately after the main event/state
    loop commences in order to provide an entrypoint for operation.
    The *enter* event can be used to, e.g., send out the first request.
    For example::

        @ESM.monitor()
        class Foo:

            @ESM.enter
            async def _enter(self):
                _ = await self._request_initialization()

            @ESM.requests
            async def _request_initialization(self):
                # ...
                return InitRequest(
                    # ...
                )

    It is not strictly necessary to provide an *enter* event.
    If the monitored class is exclusively an MDP worker, then there is no need
    for the *enter* event, because the worker reacts on the first request it
    receives and not on its own volition.

    In order to make a class use the ESM, you must decorate it with
    ::`~.monitor`. The ``monitor`` decorator can also inject all necessary
    code to handle ZMQ MDP workers.

    If the monitored class does not have a ``run`` method, the ESM will also
    inject it. The ``run`` method then serves as an event/state loop that
    continues until it is stopped. At the start of the ``run`` method, the
    target objects ``setup`` method is called if it exists. Likewise,
    a ``teardown`` method will be called immediately after the loop ends.

    The ESM also adds a ``stop`` method to the target object. It serves to
    terminate the event/state loop.

    In order to react to a specific event, users of the ESM can decorate their
    methods with ``on(event)``. The ::`~.on` decorator takes as parameter
    the class of what is handled. E.g., the class of a particular message, or
    ``signal.SIGCHLD`` to react to a process that has ended. For example::

        from palaestrai.core import EventStateMachine as ESM
        import signal

        @ESM.monitor()
        class Foo:

            @ESM.on(SomeRequest)
            async def handle_some_request(self, request):
                 # ...
                 pass

            @ESM.on(signal.SIGCHLD)
            async def handle_process_termination(self, process):
                # ...
                pass

    Spawning processes is also handled through a decorator: ``spawns``. If a
    method decorated with ``spawns`` returns a ::`Process` object, this
    process will automatically be monitored. E.g.,::

        # ...
        @ESM.spawns
        def start_some_fancy_process(self):
            p = multiprocessing.Process(target=somefunc)
            p.start()
            return p

    The ESM also handles the sending of requests. ESM-monitored classes do not
    need to instantiate and monitor MDP client objects themselves. Instead,
    they simply need methods to be decorated with ``requests``. The so
    decorated method must return a message object that has the ``receiver``
    property, so that ::`~.requests` can handle sending. E.g.,::

        # ...
        @ESM.requests
        def get_something_from_a_worker(self):
            req = SomeRequest()
            req.receiver = "Foo"
            return req

        @ESM.on(SomeResponse)    # also handle the response!
        def handle_response_from_worker(self, response):
            # ...
            pass

    The ESM also supports classes that act as workers. For this, the ESM's
    ``monitor`` decorator needs the flag ``is_mdp_worker=True``. Then, the
    ESM injects the property ``mdp_service``. Setting this property connects
    the MDP worker, and ``ESM.on`` can be used to handle requests from clients.
    For example::

        @ESM.monitor(is_mdp_worker=True)
        class Foo:
            async def setup(self):
                self.mdp_service = "Foo"

            @ESM.on(SomeRequest)
            def handle_request_from_client(self, req):
                do_something_with(request)
                rsp = SomeResponse()
                rsp.receiver = req.sender
                return rsp

        * ``stop()``: Stops the event/state loop of the class and can be
