    To dump or load a :class:`~Brain`, it needs to be located. The locator
    is represented by instances of this class. A brain is local to a specific
    agent, is used and/or trained in a particular experiment run and run phase.

    The information for this comes from the experiement run definition, i.e.,
    the experiment run document (usually written down in YAML format). All
    UIDs referenced here are user-readable IDs. Examples are "Dummy run",
    "phase_0", and "valiant_defender" for experiment run, phase, and
    agent UIDs.

    Parameters
    ----------

    agent_name : str
        Unique name (ID) of the agent that housed the :class:`~Brain` this
        locator refers to. The key in the experiment run file is ``agent``.
    experiment_run_uid : str
        UID (user defined, unique ID) of the experiment run the brain is
        located in. The key in the experiment run file is ``experiment_run``.
    experiment_run_phase : int
        Number (index, starting at 0) of the experiment run phase the brain
        is located in. The key in the experiment run file is ``phase``.
