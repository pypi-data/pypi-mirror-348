    ===================================================================
    Options

    Each of the definitions above may have "options" attached.  These are
    just annotations which may cause code to be generated slightly differently
    or may contain hints for code that manipulates protocol messages.

    Clients may define custom options as extensions of the *Options messages.
    These extensions may not yet be known at parsing time, so the parser cannot
    store the values in them.  Instead it stores them in a field in the *Options
    message called uninterpreted_option. This field must have the same name
    across all *Options messages. We then use this field to populate the
    extensions when we build a descriptor, at which point all protos have been
    parsed and so all extensions are known.

    Extension numbers for custom options may be chosen as follows:
    * For options which will only be used within a single application or
      organization, or for experimental options, use field numbers 50000
      through 99999.  It is up to you to ensure that you do not use the
      same number for multiple options.
    * For options which will be published and used publicly by multiple
      independent entities, e-mail protobuf-global-extension-registry@google.com
      to reserve extension numbers. Simply provide your project name (e.g.
      Objective-C plugin) and your project website (if available) -- there's no
      need to explain how you intend to use them. Usually you only need one
      extension number. You can declare multiple options with only one extension
      number by putting them in a sub-message. See the Custom Options section of
      the docs for examples:
      https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#options
      If this turns out to be popular, a web service will be set up
      to automatically assign option numbers.

    This is only a hint.  Implementations are free to choose whether to use
    eager or lazy parsing regardless of the value of this option.  However,
    setting this option true suggests that the protocol author believes that
    using lazy parsing on this field is worth the additional bookkeeping
    overhead typically needed to implement it.
    
    This option does not affect the public interface of any generated code;
    all method signatures remain the same.  Furthermore, thread-safety of the
    interface is not affected by this option; const methods remain safe to

    to require exclusive access.
    
    Note that implementations may choose not to check required fields within
    a lazy sub-message.  That is, calling IsInitialized() on the outer message
    may return true even if the inner message has missing required fields.
    This is necessary because otherwise the inner message would have to be
    parsed in order to perform the check, defeating the purpose of lazy
    parsing.  An implementation which chooses not to check required fields
    must be consistent about it.  That is, for any particular sub-message, the

    check its required fields, regardless of whether or not the message has

    A Location identifies a piece of source code in a .proto file which

    tools.
    
    For example, say we have a file like:
      message Foo {
        optional string foo = 1;
      }
    Let's look at just the field definition:
      optional string foo = 1;
      ^       ^^     ^^  ^  ^^^
      a       bc     de  f  ghi
    We have the following locations:
      span   path               represents
      [a,i)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0 ]     The whole field definition.
      [a,b)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 4 ]  The label (optional).
      [c,d)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 5 ]  The type (string).
      [e,f)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 1 ]  The name (foo).
      [g,h)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 3 ]  The number (1).
    
    Notes:
    - A location may refer to a repeated field itself (i.e. not to any
      particular index within it).  This is used whenever a set of elements are
      logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire
      extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will
      have an outer location whose path refers to the "extensions" repeated
      field without an index.
    - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single
      logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most
      obvious example is the "extend" block again -- there may be multiple
      extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.
    - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For
      example, the "extendee" of an extension declaration appears at the
      beginning of the "extend" block and is shared by all extensions within
      the block.
    - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span
      does not mean that it is a descendant.  For example, a "group" defines
      both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations
      corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.
    - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to
      ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could
      be recorded in the future.
