#ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

Welcome to DroidMind! This guide will help you quickly connect DroidMind to your AI assistant and run your first commands. Let's get you to that "Aha!" moment. âœ¨

## Prerequisites

- **Python & UV**: Ensure Python 3.13+ and `uv` are installed. DroidMind uses `uvx` for zero-install IDE integration.
- **AI Assistant with MCP Support**: You'll need an AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Examples include Claude Desktop, Cursor, or others listed [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).
- **Android Device/Emulator**: Have an Android device connected via USB (with USB debugging enabled) or an emulator running. For network connections, ensure ADB over TCP/IP is set up.
- **ADB**: ADB must be installed and in your system PATH.

## 1. Configure Your IDE to Run DroidMind (via `uvx`)

The quickest way to get started with DroidMind and an IDE (like Cursor) is to let the IDE manage DroidMind using `uvx`. This means you don't need to manually install or run DroidMind first.

Your IDE will look for a configuration file (e.g., `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor) to know how to launch MCP servers. You'll add an entry for DroidMind:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "droidmind": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/hyperb1iss/droidmind",
        "droidmind",
        "--transport",
        "stdio" // The default and preferred mode for most IDE integrations
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- **`command: "uvx"`**: Tells the IDE to use `uvx`.
- **`"--from", "git+https://github.com/hyperb1iss/droidmind"`**: `uvx` will fetch DroidMind directly from GitHub.
- **`"droidmind"`**: The package name to run.
- **`"--transport", "stdio"`**: Specifies the communication protocol. `stdio` is the default and preferred mode for direct IDE integrations.

Once configured, your IDE should automatically start DroidMind when needed. You typically won't see a separate terminal window for DroidMind, as the IDE manages it in the background.

**For other installation methods (manual, Docker, or running DroidMind separately), see the full [Installation Guide](installation.md).** This Quick Start focuses on the zero-install IDE integration.

## 2. Connect Your AI Assistant to DroidMind

With the `mcp.json` (or equivalent) configured, your AI assistant should automatically discover and connect to DroidMind when it starts up or when you try to use a DroidMind-related tool.

- **No Manual Connection URI Needed (Usually)**: Since the IDE launches DroidMind, the connection is typically handled internally. You usually don't need to manually input an MCP URI.

- **Instructions for Common Clients**:

  - **Cursor**:

    1. Ensure your project has a `.cursor/mcp.json` file with the DroidMind configuration shown in Step 1.
    2. Restart Cursor or open a new project window.
    3. Cursor will automatically start DroidMind on startup, making its tools immediately available.

  - **Claude Desktop**:
    1. Open Claude Desktop settings (from the main application menu).
    2. Go to `Developer` settings.
    3. Click `Edit Config` to open `claude_desktop_config.json`.
    4. Add or modify the `mcpServers` section similar to the example below. Claude Desktop is designed to launch MCP servers itself.
       ```json
       {
         "mcpServers": {
           "droidmind": {
             "command": "uvx",
             "args": [
               "--from",
               "git+https://github.com/hyperb1iss/droidmind",
               "droidmind",
               "--transport",
               "stdio" // Default and preferred for Claude Desktop
             ]
             // Add "workingDirectory": "/path/to/your/droidmind/project" if needed
             // Add "env": { ... } if DroidMind needs specific environment variables
           }
         }
       }
       ```
    5. Restart Claude Desktop. It will attempt to start DroidMind using this configuration.

**Note on SSE Transport (Alternative Method):**
If you need to use SSE transport instead of stdio (for specific use cases or compatibility reasons):

1. You'll need to run the DroidMind server manually with SSE enabled:

   ```bash
   uvx --from git+https://github.com/hyperb1iss/droidmind droidmind --transport sse --host localhost --port 4256
   ```

2. Then configure your AI client to connect to the SSE endpoint (e.g., `sse://localhost:4256/sse`).

This approach requires more manual setup but may be necessary for certain client configurations. See the [Installation Guide](installation.md) for more details on running DroidMind as a standalone server.

After successful connection (which is often automatic with IDE-managed servers), your AI assistant should indicate that DroidMind's tools are available (often indicated by a special icon or prefix in the chat input, or by the AI successfully executing DroidMind commands).

## 3. Your First Commands!

Now for the fun part! Try asking your AI assistant some questions that will leverage DroidMind's capabilities. Here are a few ideas:

- **List Connected Devices**:

  > "Hey AI, can you list all my connected Android devices using DroidMind?"
  > `Response should show a list of devices DroidMind can see via ADB.`

- **Device Properties (if a device is connected)**:
  Replace `emulator-5554` with your actual device serial from the list above.

  > "Tell me about the device `emulator-5554`. What are its properties?"
  > `Response should detail the Android version, model, SDK level, etc., for the specified device.`

- **Take a Screenshot (if a device is connected)**:

  > "Take a screenshot of my currently active Android device."
  > `Your AI assistant should display a screenshot.`

- **Check Storage Space**:

  > "How much storage space is free on `emulator-5554`?"

- **List Installed Apps (Third-Party)**:
  > "What apps have I installed on `emulator-5554`?"

## ðŸ¤” Troubleshooting

- **DroidMind Server Not Starting**: Check your terminal for error messages. Ensure Python and dependencies are correctly installed. If using Docker, check `docker logs droidmind-server`.
- **AI Assistant Can't Connect / Tools Not Working**:
  - Double-check your `mcp.json` (or equivalent) configuration for typos in the command or arguments.
  - Ensure `uv` is installed and accessible in your system's PATH (as `uvx` relies on `uv`).
  - If using `sse` transport, ensure the specified port (e.g., 4256) is not being used by another application.
  - Check your IDE's output logs or console for any error messages related to starting the MCP server.
- **No Devices Listed (when DroidMind seems to be running)**:
  - Ensure your Android device has USB debugging enabled and is authorized on your computer.
  - Run `adb devices` in a separate terminal to see if ADB itself can see your device. If not, DroidMind won't be able to either.
  - If using Docker, refer to the [Docker Guide's section on ADB connectivity](docker.md#connecting-to-adb-devices), as this is often the trickiest part.
