- **Be Specific**: When talking to your AI, provide clear details like device serials (if you have multiple) and full paths for files.
- **Iterate**: If the first command doesn't do exactly what you want, refine your request. AI assistants learn from interaction.
- **Use Serial Numbers**: If you have multiple devices connected, always specify the device serial number in your requests to avoid ambiguity.
- **Check Output**: Pay attention to the output DroidMind provides via your AI assistant. It often contains important confirmations or error messages.
