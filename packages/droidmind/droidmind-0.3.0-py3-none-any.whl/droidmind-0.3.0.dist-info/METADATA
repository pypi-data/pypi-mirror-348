              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

**Control Android devices with AI through the Model Context Protocol**

</div>

DroidMind is a powerful bridge between AI assistants and Android devices, enabling control, debugging, and system analysis through natural language. By implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), DroidMind allows AI models to directly interact with Android devices via ADB in a secure, structured way. When used as part of an agentic coding workflow, DroidMind can enable your assistant to build and debug with your device directly in the loop.

## 💫 Core Features

DroidMind empowers AI assistants to:

- 📱 **Manage Devices**: Connect via USB/TCP-IP, list devices, view properties, and reboot.
- 📊 **Analyze Systems**: Access logs (logcat, ANR, crash, battery), capture bug reports, and dump heap.
- 📂 **Handle Files**: Browse, read, write, push, pull, delete, and manage device files/directories.
- 📦 **Control Apps**: Install, uninstall, start, stop, clear data, and inspect app details (manifest, permissions, activities).
- 🖼️ **Automate UI**: Perform taps, swipes, text input, and key presses.
- 🐚 **Execute Shell Commands**: Run ADB shell commands with a security-conscious framework.
- 🔒 **Operate Securely**: Benefit from command validation, risk assessment, and sanitization.
- 💬 **Integrate Seamlessly**: Connect with any MCP-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, Cline, etc.).

For a detailed list of capabilities, see the **[User Manual](docs/user_manual/index.md)** and **[MCP Reference](docs/mcp-reference.md)**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quickstart for IDEs (Zero Install with `uvx`)

For the fastest way to integrate DroidMind with an MCP-compatible IDE (like Cursor), you can configure it to run DroidMind directly from its GitHub repository using `uvx`. This method **does not require you to manually clone or install DroidMind first**.

Add the following to your IDE's MCP configuration (e.g., `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "droidmind": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/hyperb1iss/droidmind",
        "droidmind",
        "--transport",
        "stdio" // The default and preferred mode for most IDE integrations
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Your IDE will be configured to launch DroidMind on demand. Full instructions for this setup are in the **[Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md#1-configure-your-ide-to-run-droidmind-via-uvx)**.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- `uv` (Python package manager)
- Android device with USB debugging enabled
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed and in your system's PATH

### Installation

For detailed instructions on setting up DroidMind, including the quick IDE integration with `uvx` (covered in the Quick Start), manual installation from source, or using Docker, please see our comprehensive **[Installation Guide](docs/installation.md)**.

### Running DroidMind

How you run DroidMind depends on your setup:

- **IDE Integration (via `uvx`)**: Your IDE automatically manages running DroidMind as configured in its MCP settings (e.g., `mcp.json`). See the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md).
- **Manual Installation**: After installing from source, you can run DroidMind directly.
  - **Stdio (for direct terminal interaction or some IDE setups):**
    ```bash
    droidmind --transport stdio
    ```
  - **SSE (for web UIs or AI assistants like Claude Desktop):**
    ```bash
    droidmind --transport sse
    ```
    This usually starts a server at `sse://localhost:4256/sse`.
- **Docker**: Refer to the [Docker Guide](docs/docker.md) for commands to run DroidMind in a container.

Refer to the **[Installation Guide](docs/installation.md)** for more details on running DroidMind in different environments.

## 🐳 Running with Docker

DroidMind can also be run using Docker for a consistent, containerized environment. This is particularly useful for deployment and isolating dependencies.

For comprehensive instructions on building the Docker image and running DroidMind in a container with `stdio` or `SSE` transport, including notes on ADB device access, please refer to our **[Docker Guide](docs/docker.md)**.

## 🔮 Example AI Assistant Queries

With an AI assistant connected to DroidMind, you can make requests like:

- "List all connected Android devices and show their properties."
- "Take a screenshot of my Pixel."
- "Install this APK on `emulator-5554`."
- "Show me the recent crash logs from `your_device_serial`."
- "Tap the 'Next' button on the current screen of `emulator-5554`."

For more inspiration, check out our **[Example Queries and Workflows](docs/user_manual/example_queries.md)** in the User Manual.

## 🔒 Security

DroidMind incorporates a security framework to protect your devices:

- **Command Validation & Sanitization**
- **Risk Assessment Categorization**
- **Protected Path Operations**
- **Comprehensive Logging**

High-risk operations are flagged, and critical ones are blocked by default. Learn more in our **[Security Considerations](docs/user_manual/security.md)** chapter.

## 💻 Development

DroidMind uses `uv` for dependency management and development workflows.

```bash
# Install/update dependencies (after cloning and activating .venv)
uv pip install -e .[dev,sse]

# Run tests
pytest

# Run linting
ruff check .

# Run type checking
pyright # Ensure pyright is installed or use ruff's type checking capabilities
```
