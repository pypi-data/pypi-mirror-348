# TaskFeasibilityAnalyzer

`TaskFeasibilityAnalyzer` is a Python package designed to determine the feasibility of coding tasks using GPT-3. It provides a probability score indicating whether a task can be completed successfully based on the project's structure and technology stack.

## Installation

To install `TaskFeasibilityAnalyzer`, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install TaskFeasibilityAnalyzer
```

## Usage

### As a Python Module

`TaskFeasibilityAnalyzer` can be used as a Python module in your scripts.

#### Analyzing a Task's Feasibility

```python
import json
from taskfeasibilityanalyzer import TaskFeasibilityAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer with the target directory and your OpenAI API key
analyzer = TaskFeasibilityAnalyzer('/path/to/your/project', 'your-openai-api-key')

# Analyze a task and get a probability score
task_description = "Refactor the database schema to improve performance."
probability = analyzer.analyze_task(task_description)
result = json.loads(probability)
print(f"The probability that the task can be completed successfully is {result:.2f}")
```

## Features

- **Integrates with GPT-3**: Leverages the power of GPT-3 to analyze the complexity and requirements of coding tasks.
- **Project Structure Analysis**: Uses ProjectStructoR to understand the project's structure and technology stack.
- **Probability Score**: Provides a numerical estimate indicating the feasibility of completing a task.
