# üèéÔ∏è Application to create Formula 1 Report
   This tool can build a Formula 1 report. It works from CLI and you from import in your code.
The app reads and analyzes some files from a passing directory in CLI (read data by default package),
   or you can import it in your code and pass your own files

Report-of-monaco-2018 can be installed by running
``` bash $
pip install report-of-monaco-2018==0.0.10
```


## üíª Run from CLI 
You can use this package to run it from CLI and receive a report by default this command:
 
`report-monaco` - you can pass optional ` --asc | --desc ` to sort it;

or you can choose some driver and receive a result by him:

`report-monaco --file --driver 'Sebastian Vettel'` 

## üíª Import in your project
You can import this package in your code and pass your own files:

```
import report_of_monaco_2018
