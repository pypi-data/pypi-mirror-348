Select two numeric variables for bivariate analysis;

Define classification breaks manually or using the natural breaks (Jenks) method;

Choose color ramps or input your own;

Preview and export an interactive HTML map;

(Optional) Enable the LLM-assisted mode for natural language guidance and interpretation.
