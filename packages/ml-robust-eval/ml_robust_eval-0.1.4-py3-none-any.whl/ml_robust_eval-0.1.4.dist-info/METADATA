**ML Eval Robust** is a pure Python, object-oriented library for comprehensive machine learning model evaluation, validation, and robustness testing.  
It’s is an all-in-one toolkit that features:

- 📊 **Metrics** for classification, regression, NLP, and computer vision tasks  
- 🔁 **Cross-validation** and **A/B testing** helpers  
- 📈 **Visualization** tools for confusion matrices and ROC curves (stdout-based, no dependencies!)  
- 🦾 **Automated test case generation**: edge cases, adversarial samples, and boundary value tests  
- 🧩 **No external dependencies** – works anywhere Python runs!

---

## 🚀 Installation
<code>pip install ml_robust_eval</code>

> **Note:** Pure Python! No numpy, pandas, or matplotlib required.
