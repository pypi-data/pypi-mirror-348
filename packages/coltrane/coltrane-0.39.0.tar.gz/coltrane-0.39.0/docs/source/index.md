# Introduction

`coltrane` can be used as a self-contained app framework for content sites, as a third-party app in a `Django` project to render `markdown` files, or as a static site builder. üéµ

## ‚≠ê Features

- Render `markdown` files as HTML with automatic URL routing based on the filesystem
- Local development server with live re-rendering of markdown and data
- Use JSON files as a data source
- Automatic generation of `sitemap.xml` and `rss.xml`
- Can also serve non-markdown files, e.g. `robots.txt`
- Site-wide redirects
- Deployment best practices with `Docker`, `whitenoise`, and `gunicorn` already pre-configured
- Leverage built-in or custom `Django` template tags and filters
- Include any third-party [`Django` app](https://djangopackages.org) for additional functionality
- Serve multiple domains with custom sites
- Optional building of static HTML files

## üéµ What's with the name?

`coltrane` is built on top of the `Django` web framework, which is named after [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt). This framework is named after [John Coltrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane), another (more avant-garde üé∂) jazz musician.
