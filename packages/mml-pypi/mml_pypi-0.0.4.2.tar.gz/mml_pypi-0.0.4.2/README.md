# MML (mml-pypi)
My Machine Learning (MML) Library (developed by`Nathmath`/`DOF Studio`), identified as `mml-pypi` on PyPI.

A hybrid backend (`numpy` or `torch`) machine learning and deep learning framework coding from scratch.

It is a fantastic toolkit for machine learning teaching, learning, quick application with production level performance.

Another shining feature is its `AutoNeuralNetwork` framework - automatically build, train, fine-tune, and validate a neural network especially designed for non-professional groups.
