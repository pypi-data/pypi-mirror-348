# civitdl (civitai-batch-download)

(QUICK NOTE: CivitAI seems to have changed their API so that it will require an API key for all model downloads, please see [API Key Page](/doc/api_key.md) for instructions)

**Note v2 has some changes regarding the cli args of the program. Please read the README below or run `civitdl --help` for the new arguments!**
- To see changes to v2, go to [Changes in v2](#changes-in-v2-from-v1) section.

Uses CLI to batch download Stable Diffusion models, metadata (including description of model, author, base model, example prompts and etc.) and example images (default is 3) of checkpoints, loras, and TI models from civitai!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Python3.8 or above
* `requirements.txt`

<br/>

### Installing

#### Install using PIP
```bash
pip3 install civitdl 
# pip install civitdl # if pip3 is not found
```

<br/>

#### Build from source 1
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OwenTruong/civitdl.git # Clone the project
cd civitdl # CD into project directory
pip3 install . # Use pip if pip3 is not found
```

<br />

#### Build from source 2 (if the instruction above fails with UNKNOWN package installed, else ignore this section)
```bash
# Make sure you are in project directory # use pip if pip3 is not found
python3 -m build
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
pip3 install --upgrade dist/*.whl
```
<br />


### Quick Start
To get started quickly, copy the command below.
- See [civitdl doc](/doc/civitdl.md) for more info.

``` bash
civitdl 123456 ./models
```
- Replace `123456` with your model of choice (it can be a civitai.com url or model id).
- Replace `./models` with the directory you wish to download the model to.

Example with url:
```bash
civitdl https://civitai.com/models/123456 ./models
```

<br/>

#### Configuration Program Options - civitconfig
- Configuring the program might make your life easier. You would be able to set default sorter, max images, and api key to use without running any of those options in the main program!
  - You would also be able to add and delete sorters and aliases from the program.
  - Check [civitconfig doc](/doc/civitconfig.md).
- Run `civitconfig --help` to check what options are available!

<br/>

## Changes in v2 from v1
- basic and tags sorter now downloads metadata and images to `/parent_dir/extra_data/` instead of to `/parent_dir/`
- Sorter is now more flexible/customizable (i.e. able to select individual paths model, metadata and images should go to)
- Added support for providing API Key to program to download restricted models.
  - See [api key doc](/doc/api_key.md)
- Added multiple new options to the main program, civitdl.
  - See [civitdl doc](/doc/civitdl.md)
- Added configuration to set defaults for options, and to create alias + sorters.
  - See [civitconfig doc](/doc/civitconfig.md) 
- Concurrently download images.
- Isolates each image's prompt/metadata from the model's metadata.
- Able to retry download if model fails initially.
- Faster requests.
- Added features to skip model download if model already exists in path, or locally in cache.

## Troubleshooting

------

If you encounter similar warning on Linux/Windows while building and installing manually:
```bash
  WARNING: The script civitdl is installed in '/home/OwenTruong/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
```

For Linux, please concat the path to your PATH env, example:
```bash
echo 'PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:"$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For Windows, this may help: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm

If you are building from source and the following packages are not available `setuptools, wheel, build`, please install them with `pip install setuptools wheel build`
