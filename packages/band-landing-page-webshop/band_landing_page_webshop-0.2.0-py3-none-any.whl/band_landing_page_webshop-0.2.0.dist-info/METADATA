  - Clicking the checkout button will open the Stripe Checkout page.

- <b>Custom admin page for composing a letter</b>
  - This page is only available for site admins
  - This page contains a form, which admins can use to send an email to everyone who is subscribed to the newsletter
  - Admins can include a call-to-action button
  - Furthermore, they can include unique discounts with the CTA button
  - The discounts work as unique llinks, only available if the user clicks on the button.
- ## Newsletter
  - Users can subscribe
  - Users can unsubscribe (each email contains the unsubscribe link which is based on a UUID token)
  - The site admin can send a letter to all subscribers with a simple form on a custom admin view
  - It is not possible to subscribe with the same email address multiple times
  - All form fields are validated on the backend
  - The sent emails are based on an html template to make them look good, but there is also a fallback in case the html couldn't be rendered in the email
  - Users cannot reach the admin site
  - Subscribed users are stored in a database
  - Unsubscribed users are deleted from the database
- ## Contact form
  - Users can fill out a contact form
  - The form is validated on the backend
  - The form is saved in a database
  - An email is sent to the site admin containing the contents of the contact form upon a successful submission
- ## Shop
  - Webshop with Stripe (third party payment processor integration)
  - Real payments simulated using Stripe's checkout page using the Stripe API
  - Real discount coupons and promo codes implemented with Stripe API (These can be
  created and sent from the custom admin page - send-newsletter.html - just tick the "include CTA button" checkbox
  and then specify the percentage and duration)
  - Coupon expiration handled on the UI and backend
