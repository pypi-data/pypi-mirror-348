    """
    This non-public class is the common base class of all ctypes data types. Among other things, all ctypes type
    instances contain a memory block that hold C compatible data; the address of the memory block is returned by the
    addressof() helper function. Another instance variable is exposed as _objects; this contains other Python objects
    that need to be kept alive in case the memory block contains pointers.


    Attributes:
        - _b_base: Sometimes ctypes data instances do not own the memory block they contain, instead they
            share part of the memory block of a base object. The _b_base_ read-only member is the root ctypes object that
            owns the memory block.

        - _b_needsfree: This read-only member is True if the memory block is owned by the ctypes
            object, False otherwise.

        - _objects: This member is either None or a dictionary containing Python objects that
            need to be kept alive so that the memory block contents is kept valid. This object is only exposed for debugging;
            never modify the contents of this dictionary.

class SimpleCData(CData):
    """
    This non-public class is the base class of all fundamental ctypes data types. It is mentioned here because it
    contains the common attributes of the fundamental ctypes data types. _SimpleCData is a subclass of _CData,
    so it inherits their methods and attributes. ctypes data types that are not and do not contain pointers can now
    be pickled.

    Attributes:
        - value:
            This attribute contains the actual value of the instance. For integer and pointer types,
            it is an integer, for character types, it is a single character bytes object or string, for character pointer
            types it is a Python bytes object or string.

            When the value attribute is retrieved from a ctypes instance, usually a new object is returned each time.
            ctypes does not implement original object return, always a new object is constructed. The same is true
