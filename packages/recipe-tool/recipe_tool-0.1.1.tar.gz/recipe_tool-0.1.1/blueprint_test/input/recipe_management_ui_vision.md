# Recipe Management UI System Vision

## Overview

We need a modern web-based user interface for creating, managing, and executing recipe automation files. The system should provide an intuitive visual interface that eliminates the need for command-line interaction with the recipe-tool, making automation accessible to non-technical users while providing power features for experts.

## Core Components

### Recipe Editor

- Visual interface for creating and editing recipe JSON files
- Step-by-step wizard for common recipe patterns
- Syntax highlighting and validation for recipe JSON
- Template library with common recipe patterns
- Auto-completion for step types and configuration options
- Preview functionality to visualize recipe execution flow

### Recipe Library

- Centralized repository for storing and organizing recipes
- Categorization and tagging system
- Search and filter functionality
- Version history and change tracking
- Import/export capabilities
- Sharing and collaboration features

### Execution Dashboard

- Interface for executing recipes with visual progress indicators
- Parameter/context input form generation from recipe definitions
- Real-time logging and error reporting
- Execution history with timestamps and status
- Ability to pause, resume, and cancel executions
- Visual representation of execution flow

### Context Management

- UI for creating, editing, and saving context data
- Pre-execution context preview and validation
- Context history and presets
- Template variables management
- File upload interface for file-based context data

### Output Viewer

- Structured display of recipe execution results
- Artifact visualization (code, documents, diagrams)
- Output comparison between runs
- Export functionality for outputs
- Linking outputs to source recipe steps

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web application using React for the frontend
- Backend API to interact with the recipe-executor engine
- RESTful API design with WebSocket for real-time updates
- Local file system integration for reading/writing recipes and artifacts
- Integration with version control systems
- Responsive design for desktop usage (mobile support optional)
- User authentication and permission system

## User Experience Goals

- Intuitive interface accessible to non-technical users
- Visual representation of recipe steps and flow
- Interactive editing with immediate validation feedback
- Seamless transition between editing, executing, and reviewing outputs
- Comprehensive documentation and tooltips

## Phase 1 Deliverables

1. Basic recipe editor with syntax highlighting and validation
2. Simple recipe execution interface with parameter inputs
3. Recipe library with basic organization features
4. Output viewer for text and JSON outputs
5. Local file system integration

## Future Enhancements

- Collaborative editing features
- Recipe debugging tools with breakpoints and step-by-step execution
- AI-assisted recipe creation and optimization
- Integration with external systems and APIs
- Advanced visualization for complex recipe flows
- Recipe performance analytics and optimization suggestions
- Mobile app for monitoring executions
