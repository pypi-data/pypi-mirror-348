# Task Manager API

## Project Overview

Build a simple task management API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The system should support task organization, user authentication, and basic reporting.

## Core Requirements

1. **User Authentication**

   - Support for user registration, login, and logout
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Password reset functionality
   - Role-based access control (admin, regular user)

2. **Task Management**

   - CRUD operations for tasks
   - Task attributes: title, description, due date, priority, status, assignee
   - Task categorization and tagging
   - Filtering and searching tasks

3. **Notification System**

   - Send email notifications for task assignments and due dates
   - Support for in-app notifications
   - Notification preferences management

4. **Reporting**
   - Generate basic reports on task status and completion
   - Export reports in CSV and PDF formats
   - Task analytics dashboard data

## Technical Requirements

- RESTful API design
- Node.js backend with Express framework
- MongoDB for data storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Secure: HTTPS, input validation, protection against common vulnerabilities
- Scalable: Handle at least 1000 concurrent users
- Performant: API response time under 200ms for 95% of requests
- Reliable: 99.9% uptime, proper error handling

## Future Considerations

- Team/project management features
- Integration with third-party tools (Slack, MS Teams)
- Mobile app support
- Advanced analytics and reporting
