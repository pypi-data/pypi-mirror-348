# Complex Code Generation Recipe

This recipe demonstrates a multi-step workflow that:

1. Reads two specification files.
2. Uses an LLM step to generate a comprehensive Python module that integrates both core and auxiliary functionalities.
3. Writes the generated module to disk.
4. Executes a sub-recipe to generate an additional utility module.
