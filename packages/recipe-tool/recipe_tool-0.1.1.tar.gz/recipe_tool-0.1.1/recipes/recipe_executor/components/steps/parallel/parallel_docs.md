# ParallelStep Component Usage

The **ParallelStep** component enables the concurrent execution of multiple sub-steps within a recipe. It is ideal for improving performance when independent tasks can be executed in parallel.

## Importing

Import the ParallelStep and its configuration:

```python
from recipe_executor.steps.parallel import ParallelStep, ParallelConfig
```

## Configuration

The ParallelStep is configured via a `ParallelConfig` object. This configuration defines the list of sub-steps to run concurrently, along with optional settings for controlling concurrency.

```python
class ParallelConfig(StepConfig):
    """Config for ParallelStep.

    Fields:
        substeps: List of sub-step configurations to execute in parallel.
                  Each substep must be an execute_recipe step definition (with its own recipe_path, overrides, etc).
        max_concurrency: Maximum number of substeps to run concurrently.
                         Default = 0 means no explicit limit (all substeps may run at once, limited only by system resources).
        delay: Optional delay (in seconds) between launching each substep.
               Default = 0 means no delay (all allowed substeps start immediately).
    """
    substeps: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    max_concurrency: int = 0
    delay: float = 0.0
```

## Step Registration

To enable the use of ParallelStep in recipes, register it in the step registry:

```python
from recipe_executor.steps.registry import STEP_REGISTRY
from recipe_executor.steps.parallel import ParallelStep

STEP_REGISTRY["parallel"] = ParallelStep
```

## Basic Usage in Recipes

The ParallelStep allows you to run multiple steps concurrently. Sub-steps are defined within a dedicated `substeps` array.

### Example Recipe (JSON)

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "parallel",
      "config": {
        "substeps": [
          {
            "type": "execute_recipe",
            "config": {
              "recipe_path": "recipes/subtask_a.json",
              "context_overrides": {
                "input_data": "{{shared_input}}"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "type": "execute_recipe",
            "config": {
              "recipe_path": "recipes/subtask_b.json",
              "context_overrides": {
                "input_data": "{{shared_input}}"
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        "max_concurrency": 2, // Process up to 2 sub-steps in parallel
        "delay": 0.5 // Optional delay of 0.5 seconds between starting each sub-step
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration with Other Steps

The ParallelStep is designed to integrate seamlessly with the rest of your recipe:

- **Copies of Context:** All sub-steps are provided a copy of the same context (the shared context implements ContextProtocol), enabling them to read from common data.
- **Independent Execution:** Use ParallelStep only for tasks that do not depend on each other nor write back to context beyond the parallel blockâ€™s lifecycle, as each cloned context is discarded after the parallel block completes.

## Important Notes

- **Error Handling:** If any sub-step fails, the entire parallel execution aborts. Handle errors within each sub-step to ensure graceful degradation.
- **Resource Constraints:** Adjust `max_concurrency` based on system resources to avoid overwhelming the executor.
- **Delay Between Sub-steps:** Use the `delay` parameter to control the timing of sub-step execution, which can help manage resource contention.
