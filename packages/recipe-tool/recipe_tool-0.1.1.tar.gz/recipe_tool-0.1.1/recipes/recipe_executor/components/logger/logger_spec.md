# Logger Component Specification

## Purpose

The Logger component provides a consistent logging interface. It initializes and configures logging, writes logs to appropriate files, and ensures that all components can log messages at different severity levels.

## Core Requirements

- Writes to both stdout and log files
- Allow configuration of the log directory and log levels
- Support different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
- Create separate log files for each level
- For stdout, set the log level to INFO
- Clear existing logs on each run to prevent unbounded growth
- Provide a consistent log format with timestamps, log level, source file, line number, and message
- Create log directories if they don't exist

## Implementation Considerations

- Ensure thread safety for concurrent logging
- Use Python's standard logging module directly
- Reset existing handlers to ensure consistent configuration
- Set up separate handlers for console and different log files
- Create the log directory if it doesn't exist
- Use mode="w" for file handlers to clear previous logs
- Use a custom formatter:
  - Log Format: `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d [%(levelname)s] (%(filename)s:%(lineno)d) %(message)s`
  - Log Date Format: `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`

## Logging

- Debug: Log that the logger is being initialized, the log directory being created, and any errors encountered during initialization
- Info: Log that the logger has been initialized successfully

## Component Dependencies
