# EasyCoder example scripts
The scripts in this folder are as follows:

`hello.ecs` is everybody's first program.

`fizzbuzz.ecs` is often set as a rather trivial programming challenge at job interviews.

`benchmark.ecs` is a program that can be translated into other languages and used to compare runtime performance.

`tests.ecs` is a selection of tests to verify the various language features. It could do with a major expansion to cover more of the language.

`points.ecs` shows how to use a plugin module, in this case one that manages points (pairs of values). This one is aimed at Python programmers wishing to extend the language.

`graphics-demo.ecg` demonstrates various features of the **_EasyCoder_** graphics system. Note that the filename extension is `.ecg` instead of `.ecs`, this being to signal to **_EasyCoder_** that it needs to call in the graphics module.

`wave.ecg` is a simulation of the "Mexican Wave".
