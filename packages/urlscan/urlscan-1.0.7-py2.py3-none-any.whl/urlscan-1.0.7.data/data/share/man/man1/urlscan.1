.TH URLSCAN 1 "1 June 2024"

.SH NAME
urlscan \- browse the URLs in an email message from a terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBurlscan\fR [options] <
.I message

\fBurlscan\fR [options]
.I message

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBurlscan\fR accepts a single email message on standard
input, then displays a terminal-based list of the URLs in the given
message.  Selecting a URL uses the Python webbrowser module to
determine which browser to open. The \fBBROWSER\fR environment
variable will be used if it is set.

\fBurlscan\fR is primarily intended to be used with the
.B mutt
(1) mailreader, but it should work well with any terminal-based mail
program.

\fBurlscan\fR is similar to \fBurlview\fR(1), but has the following
additional features:

\fB1.\fR Support for more message encodings, such as quoted-printable
and base64.

\fB2.\fR Extraction and display of the context surrounding each URL. Toggle
context view on/off with \fBc\fR. Reverse displayed order of URLs with \fBR\fR.

\fB3.\fR Copy current URL to primary selection with \fBP\fR or to clipboard with
\fBC\fR.

\fB4.\fR URLs are shortened by default to fit on one line. Toggle one or all
shortened URLs with \fBs\fR or \fBS\fR.

\fB5.\fR Incremental case-insensitive search using \fB/\fR. Footer shows current
search term. \fB/\fR again resets search.

\fB6.\fR Cycle through all available palettes (color and black & white available
by default) using \fBp\fR. Running \fBurlscan \-g\fR will generate a
~/.config/urlscan/config.json file for editing or adding additional pallettes
and keybindings. See

http://urwid.org/manual/displayattributes.html#display-attributes

for color options and allowed values. Set display width with `--width`.

\fB7.\fR \fBu\fR will unescape the highlighted URL if necessary.

\fB8.\fR Run a command with the selected URL as the argument or pipe the
selected URL to a command using the \fB--run-safe\fR, \fB--run\fR and
\fB--pipe\fR arguments.

\fB9.\fR Use \fBl\fR to cycle through whether URLs are opened using the Python
webbrowser module (default), xdg-open (if installed) or a function passed on the
command line with \fB--run-safe\fR or \fB--run\fR. The \fB--run\fR and
\fB--run-safe\fR functions will respect the value of \fB--pipe\fR.

\fB10.\fR \fBF1\fR shows the help menu.

\fB11.\fR Scan certain email headers for URLs. Currently \fBLink\fR,
\fBArchived-At\fR and \fBList-*\fR are scanned when \fB--headers\fR is passed.

\fB12.\fR Queue multiple URLs for opening and open them all at once with \fBa\fR and \fBo\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-compact
Compact display mode; don't show the context of each URL.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-dedupe
Remove duplicated URLs from the list of URLs.
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-regex \<expression\>
Use \<expression\> in place of the default set of regular expressions,
to be used for any kind of matching. This is useful for example when
selectively avoiding 'mailto:' links or any other pattern that urlscan
could interpret as urls (such as '<filename>.<extension>'). Usage
example:

    $ urlscan --regex 'https?://.+\.\w+' file.txt
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-run\-safe \<expression\>
Execute \<expression\> in place of opening URL with a browser. Use {} in
\<expression\> to substitute in the URL. Examples:

    $ urlscan --run-safe 'tmux set buffer {}'
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-genconf
Generate ~/.config/urlscan/config.json with default options.
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-nohelp
Start with header menu hidden.
.TP
.BR \-\-headers
Scan certain message headers for URLs. Currently Link, Archived-At and
List-* are scanned.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no-browser
Disables the selection interface and print the links to standard output.
Useful for scripting (implies \fB\-\-compact\fR).
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pipe
Pipe the selected URL to the command specified by `--run-safe` or `--run`. This
is preferred when the command supports it, as it is more secure and tolerant of
special characters in the URL. Example:

    $ urlscan --run-safe 'xclip -i' --pipe file.txt
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-reverse
Reverse displayed order of URLs.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-run \<expression\>
Execute \<expression\> in place of opening URL with a browser. Use {} in
\<expression\> to substitute in the URL. Shell features such as | and \> can be
used, but it is less secure. Examples:

    $ urlscan --run 'echo {} | xclip -i' file.txt
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-single
Exit urlscan after opening or copying a single browser link.

    $ urlscan -s file.txt
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-width
Set display width.
.TP
.BR \-W ", " \-\-whitespace\-off
Don't display empty lines and ellipses.
.TP
.BR \-C ", " \-\-colors " {true,256,88,16,8,mono}"
Set the urwid color mode. Default is "16". "true" = 2**24 colors and "mono" = 1 color.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print urlscan version.

.SH MUTT INTEGRATION

To integrate urlscan with mutt, include the following two commands in
\fB~/.muttrc\fR:


.ad l
macro index,pager \\cb "<pipe-message> urlscan<Enter>" "call urlscan to extract URLs out of a message"

macro attach,compose \\cb "<pipe-entry> urlscan<Enter>" "call urlscan to extract URLs out of a message"
.ad b


Once these lines are in your mutt configuration file, pressing
Control-b will allow you to browse and open the URLs in the currently
selected message.

Alternately, you can pipe a message into urlscan using the '|' operator. This
can be useful for applying a different flag (such as the '-d' or '-c' options).

.SH KEYBINDINGS

Run \fBurlscan \-g\fR to generate ~/.config/urlscan/config.json. All of the keys
will be listed. You can either leave in place or delete any that will not be
altered.

To unset a binding, set it equal to "". For example: \fB"P": ""\fR
