cz-benchmarks Documentation
===========================

What is cz-benchmarks?
=======================

cz-benchmarks is a package for standardized evaluation and comparison of machine learning models for biological applications (first, in the single-cell transcriptomics domain, with future plans to expand to additional domains). The package provides a toolkit for running containerized models, executing biologically-relevant tasks, and computing performance metrics. We see this tool as a step towards ensuring that large-scale AI models can be harnessed to deliver genuine biological insights -- by building trust, accelerating development, and bridging the gap between ML and biology communities.

Why benchmarking? Why now?
==========================

Last year, CZI hosted a workshop focused on benchmarking and evaluation of AI models in biology, and the `insights gained <https://virtualcellmodels.cziscience.com/micro-pub/benchmarking-workshop>`_ have reinforced our commitment to supporting the development of a robust benchmarking infrastructure, which we see as critical to achieving our Virtual Cell vision.

ðŸ’¬ Community Feedback & Contributions
======================================

We're working to get the alpha version of cz-benchmarks stable to build with the community. In the meantime, for issues you may identify, feel free to `open an issue <https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cz-benchmarks/issues>`_ on GitHub or reach out to us at `virtualcellmodels@chanzuckerberg.com <mailto:virtualcellmodels@chanzuckerberg.com>`_.
