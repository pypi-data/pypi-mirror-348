# Release Process

## Diagram of Release Workflow  

![Release Workflow Diagram](./release_workflow.png)


The repository utilizes three primary GitHub workflows to manage the release process:

1. `Conventional Commits Validation`: Ensures that all pull request titles adhere to the conventional commits format.
2. `Automated Release Management`: Uses the release-please action to generate version bumps, update release notes based on commit history, create a Release PR which includes all of the commits to be included in the next release, and create a release upon the merging of the Release PR.
3. `Publishing to PyPI`: Builds the package and publishes it to TestPyPI (with plans to move to the official PyPI registry) after a new release is published.

Maintainers of cz-benchmarks:

- To rollout a new version of cz-benchmarks to PyPi, you must first review the changes included in the release PR, approve it, then merge it.
- This will publish the new version of cz-benchmarks to TestPyPi (smoke check) then PyPi.

## Conventional Commits Validation

File: `conventional-commits.yml`

- Validates that pull request titles follow the conventional commits format.
- Ensures that commit messages indicate the type of change (major, minor, patch), which is essential for automated version bumping using Semantic Versioning.
- This helps dictate what commits get inserted in the CHANGELOG.md

### How prefixes of PR titles affect the semantic version

- Commits that start with `feat:` trigger a minor version bump.
- Commits that start with `fix:` trigger a patch version bump.
- Commits indicating a breaking change (e.g., through `BREAKING CHANGE:` or an exclamation mark like `feat!:`) trigger a major version bump.

### Examples

|Commit Message|Version Bump|
|---|---|
|`fix: handle null user case`|`PATCH`|
|`feat: add search filter by date`|`MINOR`|
|`feat!: support nested queries`|`MAJOR`|
|`BREAKING CHANGE: remove authentication service`|`MAJOR`|
|`refactor: move auth logic to separate module`|None|
|`docs: update API usage section`|None|
|`chore: upgrade eslint version`|None|

## Automated Release Management


File: `release-please.yml`

The workflow uses the [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action) action configured for Python projects. It analyzes commit messages (validated by the conventional commits check) and determines the new version. Actions taken care of by `release-please.yml`:

- Logs updates in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Creates a release PR with the changes to be included in the new version
- Upon merging the release PR ([example](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cz-benchmarks/pull/79)), it will automatically push a new tag and create a release

## Publishing to PyPi

File: `publish-pypi.yml`

Builds and push the new version of cz-benchmarks to TestPyPi and verifies it works. Once the repo goes public, we will release to the real PyPi index

After `release-please.yml` finishes publishing a new release, this workflow will be triggered. This action will:

- Build `cz-benchmarks` distributable files
- Publish to TestPyPi with `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`
- Confirm the version was published by checking with few seconds `pip index versions --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ cz-benchmarks | grep "Available.*${{ steps.get_version.outputs.VERSION }}"`
- Install and smoke test the new package

## Building Model Images

After `release-please.yml` finishes publishing a new release, this workflow will also be triggered (like `publish-pypy.yml`).

This action will:

- Build images of the models and push them to a private ECR repo that is publicly readable.
