# Batch Processing Improvements

## Overview

The implementation of the `WriteBatch` class has been improved to provide more robust batch processing. The following issues have been addressed:

1. Lack of table existence verification
2. Insufficient exception handling
3. Inadequate error logging
4. Absence of retry mechanisms
5. Incomplete transaction management

## Improvements

### 1. Table Existence Verification

Before batch processing, the existence of all target tables is now verified, and if they don't exist, they are automatically created.

```python
def _ensure_tables_exist(self):
    """
    Verify the existence of all tables used in batch operations,
    and create them if they don't exist.
    """
    # Collect target tables
    collections = set()
    for op in self._operations:
        if op[0] in ["set", "update", "delete"]:
            doc_ref = op[1]
            collections.add(doc_ref._document.collection)
    
    # Verify each table's existence
    for collection in collections:
        try:
            self._store._ensure_table_exists(collection)
            logger.debug(f"Batch operation table verification: {collection} exists")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error occurred while verifying table {collection}: {str(e)}")
            raise DatabaseError(f"Failed to ensure table exists: {collection}. Error: {str(e)}")
```

### 2. Retry Mechanism Implementation

A feature to retry operations if they fail has been added. In particular, if a "no such table" error occurs, the table is created and the operation is retried. If a `NotFoundError` occurs, an `update` operation is changed to a `set` operation and retried.

```python
def _execute_operation_with_retry(self, op, max_retries=3):
    """
    Execute a single batch operation and retry if necessary.

    Args:
        op: Tuple of the operation to execute
        max_retries: Maximum number of retries

    Returns:
        Result of the operation
    """
    retries = 0
    last_error = None

    while retries < max_retries:
        try:
            # Execute operation
            # ...
        except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
            if "no such table" in str(e) and retries < max_retries - 1:
                # If table doesn't exist, create it and retry
                # ...
            else:
                # Other SQLite errors
                # ...
        except NotFoundError as e:
            if op[0] == "update" and retries < max_retries - 1:
                # If update results in NotFoundError, change to set and retry
                # ...
            else:
                # Other NotFoundError
                # ...
        # Other exception handling
        # ...
```

### 3. Detailed Logging

Logs are now output at important points such as the start of batch processing, execution of each operation, completion, and error occurrence. This makes diagnosing and tracking problems easier.

### 4. Appropriate Exception Handling

Appropriate error handling based on the type of exception has been implemented. Instead of simply using `raise e`, more specific error information is provided.

```python
# Raise appropriate error based on exception type
if isinstance(e, (DatabaseError, ValidationError, NotFoundError)):
    raise
elif isinstance(e, sqlite3.Error):
    raise DatabaseError(f"Database error during batch operation: {str(e)}")
else:
    raise DatabaseError(f"Error during batch operation: {str(e)}")
```

### 5. Transaction Management Improvement

Redundant `BEGIN TRANSACTION` has been removed, and standard SQLite transaction management is now used. In case of errors, appropriate rollback is performed and detailed error information is provided.

## Usage Example

```python
from storekiss import Client

# Initialize client
client = Client()

# Get collection reference
users = client.collection("users")

# Create batch processing
batch = client.batch()

# Add operations to batch
user1_ref = users.document("user1")
user2_ref = users.document("user2")
user3_ref = users.document("user3")

batch.set(user1_ref, {"name": "User 1", "age": 30})
batch.update(user2_ref, {"status": "active"})
batch.delete(user3_ref)

# Commit batch
results = batch.commit()
```

## Notes

- Batch processing is atomic - either all operations succeed or all operations fail.
- When performing a large number of operations at once, it is recommended to split them into appropriate sizes.
- If an error occurs, check the logs to identify the cause.
