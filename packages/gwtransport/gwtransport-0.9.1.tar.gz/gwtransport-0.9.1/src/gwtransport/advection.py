"""
Advection Analysis for 1D Aquifer Systems.

This module provides functions to analyze compound transport by advection
in aquifer systems. It includes tools for computing concentrations of the extracted water
based on the concentration of the infiltrating water, extraction data and aquifer properties.

The model assumes requires the groundwaterflow to be reduced to a 1D system. On one side,
water with a certain concentration infiltrates ('cin'), the water flows through the aquifer and
the compound of interest flows through the aquifer with a retarded velocity. The water is
extracted ('cout').

Main functions:
- forward: Compute the concentration of the extracted water by shifting cin with its residence time. This corresponds to a convolution operation.
- gamma_forward: Similar to forward, but for a gamma distribution of aquifer pore volumes.
- distribution_forward: Similar to forward, but for an arbitrairy distribution of aquifer pore volumes.
