The meaning of life varies across philosophical, psychological, and cultural perspectives. 

1. **Philosophers** like Aristotle focus on eudaimonia, or flourishing through virtue, while existentialists such as Sartre argue that meaning is self-created through personal choices. Nietzsche believes life's meaning lies in pursuing significant goals, and Stoics emphasize virtue and self-control. (Source: Philosophical Literature)

2. **Psychological research** indicates that a sense of purpose enhances well-being and is linked to engagement in meaningful activities. Viktor Frankl's logotherapy stresses finding meaning through personal values and relationships, even amidst adversity. (Source: Psychological Research)

3. **Cultural and religious beliefs** show diverse views: Eastern philosophies like Buddhism aim for enlightenment to escape suffering, Abrahamic religions focus on serving God, Taoism seeks harmony with nature, and existentialism posits that individuals must create their own meaning.
