### üí¨ Q1: Why am I failing to parse LLM output format / How to select the right LLM?

<div class="faq-answer">
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Small language models often struggle to follow prompts and generate responses in the expected format. For better results, we recommend using large reasoning models such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DeepSeek-R1 671B</li>
  <li>OpenAI o-series models</li>
  <li>Claude 3.7 Sonnet</li>
</ul>

<p>These models provide superior reasoning capabilities and are more likely to produce correctly formatted outputs.</p>
