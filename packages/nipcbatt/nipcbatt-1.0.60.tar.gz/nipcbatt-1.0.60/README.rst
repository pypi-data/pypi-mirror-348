About
=====

The **nipcbatt** package contains an API (Application Programming Interface) for interacting with 
the NI-DAQmx driver and with LabVIEW runtime to perform measurement, generation and communication 
operations. The package is implemented in Python, as a highly object-oriented package.

Python PCB Assembly Test Toolkit or **nipcbatt** is a collection of Measurement Library, Automation Examples,
Test Demo Example developed in Python along with Documentation for PCB Assembly electrical functional test.

**nipcbatt** package is focused on NI DAQ devices hardware, and compatible with NI PC Based DAQ, CompactDAQ,
TestScale and high level enough to be applicable or scalable for other instruments with similar functionality and 
resources on any platform.

Installation
============

You can use `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ to download **nipcbatt** from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/nipcbatt/>`_ and install it::

  $ python -m pip install nipcbatt


Manual Driver Installation
--------------------------

Visit `ni.com/downloads <http://www.ni.com/downloads/>`_ to download the latest version of **Python PCB Assembly Test
Toolkit**. It is recommended you continue to install the NI-DAQmx Runtime with Configuration Support and NI Hardware Configuration Utility from the Additional items
checklist as it is required to access and manage hardware. All other recommended Additional items
are not necessary for nipcbatt to function, and they can be removed to minimize installation size. 

Getting Started
===============

In order to use the **nipcbatt package**, you must have at least one DAQ (`Data Acquisition <https://www.ni.com/en/shop/data-acquisition.html>`_)
device installed on your system. Both physical and simulated devices are supported. The examples below use PC 
based DAQ device (PCIe-6353). You can use NI MAX or NI Hardware 
Configuration Utility to verify and configure your devices.


Finding and configuring device name in **NI MAX**:

Then refer to the Validation examples and Automation sequences to start testing. Refer to the Getting Started Guide for information.


Key Concepts in Python PCBATT
=============================

1. Libraries
-------------

All the measurement libraries consist of three main methods which have to be used in the following order:

- Initialize:
 
   Used to initialize a DAQmx using either physical or global virtual channels 
   provided to perform the respective task.

   This is done by calling the intialize() method on the class instance.

Example code to initialize an instance of DRVG to generate a DC Voltage:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import nipcbatt
  >>> drvg = nipcbatt.DcVoltageGeneration()
  >>> drvg.initialize(analog_output_channel_expression="Sim_PC_basedDAQ/ao0")


- Configure and Generate/Configure and Measure:
 
   Configures, Initiates and Measure/Generate for an input/output 
   task respectively. Also, can return raw data for external custom post 
   analysis and measurements from embedded analysis(selectable/optional)
 
   This is done by calling the
   configure_and_measure()/configure_and_generate() method on the class instance.

Example code to configure and generate DC voltage using the class instance:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> drvg.configure_and_generate(nipcbatt.DEFAULT_DC_VOLTAGE_GENERATION_CONFIGURATION)
  ... # Default generation voltage is 1.2V, Defaut Range is [-10.0, 10.0]


- Close:
 
   Closes the DAQmx tasks and clears resources.

   This is done by calling the close() method on the class instance.
  
Example code to close the task and clear resources after generation:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> drvg.close()


2. Features and Utilities
-------------------------

- Virtual Channels 

   Virtual channels, or sometimes referred to generically as channels, are software entities that encapsulate the physical channel along with 
   other channel specific information (e.g.: range, terminal configuration, and custom scaling) that formats the data. A physical channel is a 
   terminal or pin at which you can measure or generate an analog or digital signal. A single physical channel can include more than one 
   terminal, as in the case of a differential analog input channel or a digital port of eight lines. Every physical channel on a device has a unique 
   name (for instance, cDAQ1Mod4/ai0, Dev2/ao5, and Dev6/ctr3) that follows the NI-DAQmx physical channel naming convention. 
   Refer to `NI-DAQmx Channel <https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-daqmx/page/chans.html>`_ for more information.

- Logger

   The logger is a feature which comes along with the package as a part of PCBATT Utilities and helps in 
   storing configuration details and results for every run of the sequences. It can be used to store results 
   in the *.txt* or *.csv* file formats. The logger stores results for every run in the same file. Example usage of the logger can be found 
   in the automation sequences.

- Save Traces

   This Utility works in a similar manner as the logger but it saves configuration settings and results for each run in separate files.
   Example usage of the save_traces module can be found in the validation examples.



Usage
=============
 
1. Validation Examples
---------------------------
 
Validation examples are created as examples for testing and validating a pair of
libraries together, where one library is used for generation and another for measurement.
The validation examples can be found in this location `pcbatt_validation_examples <https://github.com/ni/nipcbatt/tree/main/src/nipcbatt/pcbatt_validation_examples>`_.

The following images shows sample results for Signal Voltage Generation to Frequency Domain Voltage Measurement Validation example which
is located at *"/pcbatt_validation_examples/PCIe_examples/PC_SVG_FDVM.py"*:

2. Automation Sequences
-----------------------

Automation sequences are examples of using libraries for real time
scenarios like microphone tests, LED tests and so on. Automation sequences are tested in simulation mode.

Following is the list of Automation Sequences provided as a part of the package.

a. action_button_tests

b. audio_tests

c. communication_tests

d. digital_io_tests

e. led_tests

f. microphone_tests

i. synchronization_tests

The Automation Sequences can be found in this location `pcbatt_automation <https://github.com/ni/nipcbatt/tree/main/src/nipcbatt/pcbatt_automation>`_.

 
3. Functional Test Demo Sequence
---------------------------------
 
FT demo sequence is an example for creating a test sequence using
libraries with applying test limits on the results to determine whether the test is a pass or a fail.

Please refer to the FT Demo Sequence in the location `pcbatt_ft_demo_test_sequence <https://github.com/ni/nipcbatt/tree/main/src/nipcbatt/pcbatt_ft_demo_test_sequence>`_.
