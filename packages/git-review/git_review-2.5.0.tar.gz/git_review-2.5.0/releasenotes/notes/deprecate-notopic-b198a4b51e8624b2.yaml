upgrade:
  - |
    Git-review no longer supplies a default topic when uploading a new
    change.  The only way to set a topic on a newly uploaded change is
    to use the ``-t <topic>`` option.
  - |
    When downloading changes using ``git-review -d``, the local branch
    name is now based on the change number rather than the author and
    topic.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``gitreview.notopic`` configuration setting and ``-T`` command line
    option are deprecated and no longer have any effect.  The default behavior
    is now as if ``notopic`` is set.
