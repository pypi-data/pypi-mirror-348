## Installation

### 1. Using pip

```bash
pip install phosphobot
```

If you already use `uv` to manage Python versions and deps:

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Add phosphobot to your project
uv add phosphobot
```

## Quick Start

Once installed, you can start the phosphobot server instantly.

```bash
# Verify installation and view info
phosphobot info

# Start the teleoperation server (default: localhost:80)
phosphobot run

# For custom port, e.g. 8080
phosphobot run --port 8080
```

If youâ€™re managing via uv:

```bash
uv run phosphobot info
uv run phosphobot run
```

## Dashboard & Control

After launching the server, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://<YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS>:<PORT>/
```

By default, the address is [localhost:80](localhost:80)

Here you can:

- **Teleoperate** your robot via keyboard, leader arm, or Meta Quest
- **Record** demonstration datasets (40 episodes recommended)
- **Train** and **deploy** action models directly from the UI
