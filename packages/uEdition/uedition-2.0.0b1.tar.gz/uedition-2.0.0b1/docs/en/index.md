# μEdition

The process of creating and making available a (critical) digital edition often presents projects with a range of significant
hurdles, particularly around technical knowledge and hosting costs. The μEdition is a framwork that lowers these barriers by
providing a simple tool that supports users in easily building (multi-lingual) digital editions that can then easily be made
available online using free or low-cost hosting solutions.

## Quickstart

To quickly get started with the μEdition follow these steps:

1. Install [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/) for your operating system.
2. Create a new folder for your μEdition.
3. Download the default {download}`_static/pyproject.toml` and move that into your new folder.
4. Open a new terminal, change into your new folder and run the following command:

   :::{code-block} console
   hatch run init
   :::

   This creates the configuration file ({file}`uEdition.yml`) and table of contents ({file}`toc.yml`).

5. Then run the following command to add content in a new language:

   :::{code-block} console
   hatch run language add
   :::

   This will ask you a few questions about the new language and then create the required files.

5. Then run the following command to start the writing server:

   :::{code-block} console
   hatch run serve
   :::

Your new μEdition will be available at http://localhost:8000.
