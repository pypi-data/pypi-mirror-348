**ros2em** is a CLI tool to create and manage isolated ROS2 environments using VirtualBox and Vagrant.

Whether you're a robotics developer, student, or researcher, `ros2em` makes it easy to:

* 🧠 Launch ROS2 in clean, isolated virtual machines
* 🖥 Access GUIs like Rviz or Gazebo via browser
* ✅ Support both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures
* 🧰 Handle setup: VirtualBox, Vagrant, and box file download

---

## 🚀 Features

* ⚡ One-line setup for fully functional ROS 2 VMs
* 📦 Architecture-specific box handling (`amd64`, `arm64`)
* 🖥 GUI access using browser
* 🔐 No system pollution – nothing touches your host machine
* 💡 Powered by Typer (CLI) and Rich (colored output)
