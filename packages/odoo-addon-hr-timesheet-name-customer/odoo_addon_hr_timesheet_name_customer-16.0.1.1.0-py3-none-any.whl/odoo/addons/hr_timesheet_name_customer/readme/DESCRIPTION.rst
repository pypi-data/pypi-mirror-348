This module adds additional field "Description Customer" which is used for customer timesheet reports.
It also shows the "Description Customer" instead of the "Description" field in the customer portal.
By default this field will be populated from the "Description" field of the timesheet.

New report "Timesheet Customer" is added to print timesheets with "Customer Description" instead of the "Description" field.
