# Poffertjes

Friendly interface to run probabilistic queries on dataframes.

## Why "Poffertjes"?

Since I basically stole the "friendly interface idea" from [Vincent Warmerdam's `peegeem`](https://github.com/koaning/peegeem), I wanted to pay him tribute.
When I was a kid I visited Netherlands and I fell in love with [poffertjes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poffertjes): this project is filled with _syntactic sugar_, so these sweets seemed a good fit!
