def open_detached(path: str, *args) -> None:
    """
    Opens a new process in a detached state.


    Args:
        path (str): The path to the executable file.
        *args: Additional arguments to be passed to the executable.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return anything.

    Description:
        This function uses the `subprocess.Popen` method to create a new process
        and execute the specified executable file with the given arguments. The
        process is created in a detached state, meaning it runs independently
        of the parent process. The standard input, output, and error streams of
        the process are set to be pipes. The `creationflags` parameter is used
        to specify the creation flags for the process, including `DETACHED_PROCESS`,
        `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, and `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`.

    Example:
        ```python
        open_detached("path/to/executable", "arg1", "arg2")
        ```
