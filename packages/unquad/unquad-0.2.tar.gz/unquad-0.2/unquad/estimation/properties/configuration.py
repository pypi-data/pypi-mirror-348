class DetectorConfig:
    """Configuration for a conformal anomaly detector.

    Attributes:
        alpha (float): Significance level for statistical tests or other
            computations. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is ``0.2``.
        adjustment (Adjustment): Method for adjusting p-values or thresholds.
            Defaults to ``Adjustment.BH`` (Benjamini-Hochberg).
        aggregation (Aggregation): Method used for aggregating metrics or data
            points. Defaults to ``Aggregation.MEDIAN`` (median).
        seed (int): Random seed for reproducibility in stochastic processes.
            Default is ``1``.
        silent (bool): Suppresses logs or warnings if True. Default is ``True``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``alpha`` is not between 0 and 1, or if ``seed`` is
            negative.
