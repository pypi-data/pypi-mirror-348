GPkit is a Python package for defining and manipulating
geometric programming models,
abstracting away the backend solver.
Supported solvers are
[mosek](http://mosek.com)
and [cvxopt](http://cvxopt.org/).

[![CI Status](https://github.com/whoburg/gpkit/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/whoburg/gpkit/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Originally developed with Ned Burnell, whose extensive contributions were foundational to the early design.
