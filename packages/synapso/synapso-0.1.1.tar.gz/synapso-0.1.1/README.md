**Synapso** is a local-first, privacy-focused semantic search engine for your personal knowledge base. It‚Äôs built to work seamlessly with `.txt` and `.md` files, making it ideal for Obsidian, Logseq, and other markdown-based note-taking workflows.

Synapso enables semantic search over local documents without sending data to the cloud. Your ideas stay on your machine ‚Äî but your ability to find and connect them gets smarter.

---

## üöÄ Why Synapso?

- **Local-First:** Your data never leaves your machine by default.
- **Markdown-Native:** Works with plain `.md` and `.txt` files.
- **CLI-Focused:** Designed for developers and power users who prefer terminal workflows.
- **Modular:** Future-ready architecture to support Bring Your Own Model (BYOM), file watchers, and custom storage backends.
- **Open-Core:** Core is open source. Future monetization will be built around multi-device and premium features.

## üß† Project Vision

Synapso aims to become a trusted, local alternative to cloud-based knowledge systems. The goal is to build an extensible foundation for semantic search that integrates with your existing tools, works offline, and respects your privacy.

## üîß Installation

```bash
pip install synapso
```

> Requires Python 3.9+

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage (Coming Soon)

The CLI will follow this general structure:

```bash

synapso cortex index
synapso cortex list
synapso query "What did I write about knowledge graphs?"
```
