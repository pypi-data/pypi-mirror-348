A powerful distributed AI framework for collaborative intelligence and swarm learning.

## Description

TheSwarm is a Python library that enables distributed AI systems to operate collaboratively. It provides mechanisms for collective intelligence, coordinated learning, and emergent behavior across multiple AI agents.

*Note: This project is currently under active development.*

## Installation

```bash
pip install theswarm
```

## Quick Start

```python
from theswarm import Swarm, Agent

# Initialize a swarm with custom configuration
swarm = Swarm(capacity=10, communication_protocol="mesh")

# Add agents to the swarm
for i in range(5):
    agent = Agent(
        agent_id=f"agent-{i}",
        model_type="transformer",
        specialization="general"
    )
    swarm.add_agent(agent)

# Run collaborative learning
swarm.initialize()
results = swarm.solve(problem="classification", data=your_dataset)
print(results.summary())
```

## Features

- **Distributed Intelligence**: Coordinate AI agents across multiple processes or systems
- **Collective Learning**: Share and synchronize knowledge across the swarm
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Dynamic resource allocation and task prioritization
- **Fault Tolerance**: Resilient operation when individual agents fail
- **Scalable Architecture**: From small local swarms to large distributed systems
- **Flexible Integration**: Compatible with popular ML frameworks

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- PyTorch (optional)
- TensorFlow (optional)
