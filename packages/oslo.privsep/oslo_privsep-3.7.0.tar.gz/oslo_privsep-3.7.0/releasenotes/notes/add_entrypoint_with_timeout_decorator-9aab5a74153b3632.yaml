    Add ``timeout`` as parameter to ``PrivContext`` and add
    ``entrypoint_with_timeout`` decorator to cover the issues with
    commands which take random time to finish.
    ``PrivsepTimeout`` is raised if timeout is reached.

    ``Warning``: The daemon (the root process) task won't stop when timeout
    is reached. That means we'll have less available threads if the related
    thread never finishes.
