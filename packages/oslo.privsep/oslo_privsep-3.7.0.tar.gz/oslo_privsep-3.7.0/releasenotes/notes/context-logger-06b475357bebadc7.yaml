    ``PrivContext`` accepts a new string parameter called ``logger_name`` to
    define the logger we want to use for the daemon logs of this context.

    By default all contexts use ``oslo_privsep.daemon``, but in some cases we
    may need finer grained log levels, for example nova running in debug mode
    could log its own privsep calls on INFO level regardless, but leave all
    libraries' privsep calls, such as os-brick's, to be logged in the normal
    DEBUG level.
