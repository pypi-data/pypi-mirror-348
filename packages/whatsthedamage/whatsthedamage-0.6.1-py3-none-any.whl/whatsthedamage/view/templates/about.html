        <h1>About ‘whatsthedamage‘</h1>
        <p>This tool is designed to process CSV files and generate insightful reports. It relies on your bank's export functionality to save your historical data into CSV format.</p>
        <p>It is an opinionated tool written in Python to process K&H HU's bank account transaction exports in CSV files.
        The predefined settings works best with CSVs exported from K&H HU, but I made efforts to customize the behavior and potentially work with any other CSV format other finance companies may produce.

        The tool origially was meant to be a CLI tool, but I decided to make it a web application to make it more accessible to a wider audience. </p>
        <p>Both the CLI and the Web app are published under GPL-3.0 license.</p>
        <h2>The problem it solves</h2>
        <p>Your bank may provide you useful reports about your finances. I can either rely on these reports, if available, or generate my own.</p>
        <p>I consider my financial details to be a private matter between myself and my chosen bank. To process my bank account exports, I need a solution that ensures only I have access to the data. So no 3rd party solution was acceptable for me.</p>

        <p class="bg-warning">The web site does not keep any of your data. All uploaded content is removed as soon as the report is created.</p>
