# TopDesign

TopDesign is a general tool chain integration platform for multidisciplinary 
analysis and optimization, developed in DTU Wind as an open source tool.

The concept of the platform and the usage example on wind farm design can be 
found in:

> Feng, Ju, and Jens Nørkær Sørensen. "Towards a general tool chain integration 
platform for multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization in wind energy." In 
*Journal of Physics: Conference Series*, vol. 2767, no. 8, p. 082014. IOP 
Publishing, 2024.  [[link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2767/8/082014/meta)]

Source code of the platform is hosted in DTU Wind's GitLab site: 
> https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/basic-plugins/topdesign

Development of this platform has been partially supported by the [MERIDIONAL](
https://meridional.eu/) project, which receives funding from the European
Union’s Horizon Europe Programme under the grant agreement No. 101084216.

## Installation

You can install the TopDesign package from PyPI using the following command:

>```
> pip install topdesign
>```

You can also install TopDesign from GitLab (includes any recent updates):
>```
> pip install git+https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/basic-plugins/topdesign.git
>```

We highly recommend developers to install TopDesign into a dedicated 
environment. The commands to clone and install TopDesign with developer options
including dependencies required to run the tests into the current active 
environment in an Anaconda Prompt are as follows:
>```
> git clone https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/basic-plugins/topdesign.git
> cd topdesign
> pip install -e .
>```


## Usage
The standard topdesign platform relies only on [numpy](https://numpy.org/), 
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [scipy](https://scipy.org/). 

To run the example on wind farm design, you need to have 
[py_wake](
https://topfarm.pages.windenergy.dtu.dk/PyWake/) and [floris](
https://nrel.github.io/floris/installation.html) (>=4.0) installed.

To run the example on multi-language model integration, you need to have
[matlabengine](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html) 
and [juliacall](https://juliapy.github.io/PythonCall.jl/stable/juliacall/) 
installed.
