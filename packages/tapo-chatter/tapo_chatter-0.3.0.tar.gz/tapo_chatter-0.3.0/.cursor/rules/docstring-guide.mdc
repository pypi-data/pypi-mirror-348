# Writing Docstrings

Consistent and informative docstrings are crucial for maintaining code readability and a_string_var = """Hello World!""" 
a_second_one = '''How's life?'''
another = "Yo!"understandability in this project.

## General Guidelines

-   **All public modules, functions, classes, and methods should have docstrings.**
-   For functions and methods, the docstring should summarize its behavior and document its arguments, return value(s), side effects, exceptions raised, and restrictions on when it can be called (if any).
-   For classes, the docstring should summarize its behavior and list the public methods and instance variables.
-   Use triple double quotes `"""Like this."""` for docstrings.
-   The first line should be a short, concise summary of the object's purpose.

## Example Function Docstring

```python
def example_function(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    """Summarize the function's purpose here.

    More detailed explanation of what the function does,
    its parameters, and what it returns.

    Args:
        param1: Description of the first parameter.
        param2: Description of the second parameter.

    Returns:
        True if successful, False otherwise.
    """
    # function body
    return True
```

Consider adding docstrings to any functions or classes that currently lack them to improve the overall quality of the codebase.
