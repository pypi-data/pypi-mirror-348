# Formatting Python Code with Ruff

This project uses `ruff` for formatting Python code. To format a specific file, you can use the following command:

```bash
ruff format <file_path.py>
```

To format all files in the project:

```bash
ruff format .
```

The ruff formatting configuration can be found in [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml).
