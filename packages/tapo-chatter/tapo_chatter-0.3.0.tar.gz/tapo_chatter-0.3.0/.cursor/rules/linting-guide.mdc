# Linting Python Code with Ruff

This project uses `ruff` for linting Python code. To lint a specific file, you can use the following command:

```bash
ruff check <file_path.py>
```

To check all files in the project:

```bash
ruff check .
```

To attempt to automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
ruff check --fix <file_path.py>
# or for the whole project
ruff check . --fix
```

Refer to the [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) for the specific ruff configuration used in this project.
