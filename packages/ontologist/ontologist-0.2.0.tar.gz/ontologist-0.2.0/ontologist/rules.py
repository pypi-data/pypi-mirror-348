    # When a property has a value outside its allowed range.

    # When a data property value's type (like string, integer) does not match the expected type.

    CLASS_HIERARCHY = "Class hierarchy violation"
    # When a class is placed incorrectly within the hierarchy, breaking the logical structure.

    # When the number of instances for a class or property exceeds or falls short of the specified cardinality.

    CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY = "Circular dependency violation"
    # When a class or property is involved in a circular reference, causing an infinite loop.

    # When a functional property is violated by having more than one value for a single instance.
