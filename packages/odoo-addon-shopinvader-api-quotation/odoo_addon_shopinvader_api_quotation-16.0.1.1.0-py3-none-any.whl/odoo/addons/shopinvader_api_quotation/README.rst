This module adds a REST API for shopinvader to manage quotations (see module: sale_quotation)


Initially, the quotation has the `shopinvader_state` "estimating".
After updating the price manually when the button "sent" on Odoo backend
is submitted, the quotation will be sent by email (native behaviour) and the
shopinvader_state will switch to "estimated".

On Shopinvader site, the customer can see the state, the amount ... of quotation.


Why this module and how it can be used?

If you have many different product without price, and these products can only be selled on demand (compute price, need a seller action).
This module allow your customer to request quotation with products only on quotation (shop_only_quotation)
Your customer can add to cart product without price and request a quotation for a cart.

Usage
=====

This addons provides 2 new routers: `quotation_router` and 
`quotation_cart_router`. The `quotation_cart_router` is declared
with the same tags as the one defined in the `shopinvader_api_cart`
addon. As this one, no prefix is added to the router, to allow to mount
it as a nested app. See the README of `shopinvader_api_cart` for
more details on how to do it.

As all api addons, installing this addon will not have any effect on the
existing fastapi app. You must add the routers to the app by yourself by
editing your fastapi.endpoint where you want to add the routes.
