This module adds a REST API for shopinvader to manage quotations (see module: sale_quotation)


Initially, the quotation has the `shopinvader_state` "estimating".
After updating the price manually when the button "sent" on Odoo backend
is submitted, the quotation will be sent by email (native behaviour) and the
shopinvader_state will switch to "estimated".

On Shopinvader site, the customer can see the state, the amount ... of quotation.


Why this module and how it can be used?
