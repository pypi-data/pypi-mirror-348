* DjVuLibre (≥ 3.5.26)
* Python_ (≥ 3.6)
* Cython_ (≥ 0.28)

Installation
============

The easiest way to install djvulibre-python is from PyPI::

    pip install djvulibre-python

Alternatively, you can use djvulibre-python without installing it, straight out of an unpacked source tarball or a VCS checkout.

It's also possible to install it from source for the current interpreter with::

   pip install .

About this fork
===============

This repository is a Python3-only version of the original repository.

Due to the upstream repository having been archived (`Issue #23`_), this fork will now be maintained on its own. Please note that I do not have any plans on implementing completely new features for now. Nevertheless, I am going to try to keep this fork working for at least the parts which I actually use on a regular basis (as part of *ocrodjvu*).

Differences from upstream
-------------------------

* Package requires Python ≥ 3.6.
* Conform to PEP8 coding style.
* Refactor build to not use the deprecated *distutils* module any more.
* Drop support for building the package on Windows. I do not use it there and there have not been automated tests for it. If someone wants to get this back to work and help maintaining it, feel free to open an issue.
* Add support for Cython 3.0, while dropping some old backwards-compatibility code.
