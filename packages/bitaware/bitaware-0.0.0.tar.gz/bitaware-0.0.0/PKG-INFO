## Usage

### Define

```python
from bitaware import BitFlag, BitwiseAware

class PermissionTypes(BitFlag):
    ADMIN = 1
    USER = 2
    GUEST = 4
    MODERATOR = 8

class UserPermission(BitwiseAware[PermissionTypes]):
    def __init__(self, value: int):
        super().__init__(value, PermissionTypes)
    pass
```

### Use

Standalone:

```python
permission = UserPermission(Types.ADMIN | Types.USER)

print(perm.has(Types.ADMIN))  # True
print(perm.has(Types.GUEST))  # False
```

As Pydantic field:

```python
class User(BaseModel):
    permissions: UserPermission
```
