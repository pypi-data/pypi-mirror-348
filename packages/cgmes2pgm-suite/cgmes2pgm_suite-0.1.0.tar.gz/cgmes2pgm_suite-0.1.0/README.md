# CGMES2PGM-Suite

`cgmes2pgm_suite` provides additional tools for `cgmes2pgm_converter` to integrate [PowerGridModel](https://github.com/PowerGridModel/power-grid-model) with the Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES).
It focuses on performing the state estimation on CGMES datasets.

## Features

- Human readable exports of PGM Datasets in TXT and Excel
- Debug state estimation by manipulating datasets (e.g., subnet splitting)
- Configure conversion and state estimation via a configuration file
- Simulate measurements:
  - when real measurements are not provided via an Operation Profile, but a State Variable (SV) Profile is available
  - generates an Operation Profile with distorted measurements based on the SV Profile

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

The package can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install cgmes2pgm_suite
```

## Usage

[Example](./example) contains examples on how to use the package.

### Running as Standalone

This package can be run as a standalone application, performing the conversion and running PGM's state estimation. To do so, you need to install the package and then run the following command:

```bash
python -m cgmes2pgm_suite --config <path_to_config_file>
```

The provided configuration file contains the dataset configuration and the parameters for the conversion and state estimation.
An example configuration file can be found in [/example](./example).

### Datasets

The conversion, measurement simulation and state estimation has been tested with the CGMES conformity datasets.
These datasets can be obtained from [ENTSO-E CIM Conformity and Interoperability](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/cim/cim-conformity-and-interoperability/)
respecting their License.

The following datasets have been tested:

| Dataset | Size (Nodes) | Estimation Result | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PowerFlow | 2 | 游릭 | |
| PST | 2 | 游릭 | All three Scenarios |
| MiniGrid | 13 | 游릭 | |
| MicroGrid | 13 | 游릭 | PST with AsymmetricalPhaseTapChanger (BE-TR2_2) has been split |
| SmallGrid | 167 | 游릭 | |
| Svedala | 191 | 游릭 | |
| RealGrid | 6051 | 游리 | Requires smaller sigmas in measurement simulation to converge |
| FullGrid | 26 | ? | SV-Profile does not contain power flows for all branches, resulting in an insufficient amount of simulated measurements |

The configuration used for the `SmallGrid` dataset is located at [./example/SmallGrid.yaml](./example/SmallGrid.yaml) and can be executed with the following command:

```bash
python -m cgmes2pgm_suite --config ./example/SmallGrid.yaml
```

See [state_estimation.ipynb](./example/state_estimation.ipynb) on how to create the required SPARQL endpoint.

Dataset Version: CGMES Conformity Assessment Scheme Test Configurations v3.0.2
