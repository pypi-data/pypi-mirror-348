# Game Programming Patterns (gpp)

## Overview
The `gpp` package provides a collection of design patterns and best practices for game programming. It aims to help developers implement common patterns in their games, improving code organization, maintainability, and performance.

This collection is from Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom. 

The code however may vary from the authors' original implementation. The book is a very good read, highly recommended.

## Installation
To install the `gpp` package, you can use pip:

```
pip install gpp
```

## Usage
Here are some examples of how to use the `gpp` package in your game development projects:

```python
from gpp import SomeClass

# Example usage of SomeClass
instance = SomeClass()
instance.do_something()
```
