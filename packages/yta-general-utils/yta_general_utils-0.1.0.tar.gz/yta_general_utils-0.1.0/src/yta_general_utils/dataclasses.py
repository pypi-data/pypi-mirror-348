"""
When we handle files with our system we obtain them
in different formats. Sometimes we get them from urls
so they are just a bytes array, and sometimes we 
obtain an image, for example, that has been previously
loaded with its corresponding library.

We try to treat all those files in the same way so we
have created this class to interact with them and make
easier the way we handle them.
