# vrmlx
Toolkit for parsing and traversing VRML files.
Includes a standalone VRML parser library (```vrmlproc```) and a conversion library for transforming VRML into geometry format such as STL (```togeom```), with modular C++ backends and Python bindings (```vrmlxpy```).

The modular architecture allows users to define their own actionsâ€”custom functions that process VRML nodes in any desired way. This flexibility enables conversions beyond STL, such as transforming VRML data into a custom geometry JSON format. Simply implement the necessary actions to achieve your desired output.
