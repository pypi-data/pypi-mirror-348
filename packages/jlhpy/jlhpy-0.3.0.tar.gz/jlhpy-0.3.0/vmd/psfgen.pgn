# guesscoord

regenerate angles dihedrals
# Purpose: Remove all angles and/or dihedrals and completely regenerate them 
# using the segment automatic generation algorithms. This is only needed if 
# patches were applied that do not correct angles and bonds. Segment and file 
# defaults are ignored, and angles/dihedrals for the entire molecule are 
# regenerated from scratch.
# Arguments: angles: Enable generation of angles from bonds.
#            dihedrals: Enable generation of dihedrals from angles.
# Context: After one or more segments have been built.
