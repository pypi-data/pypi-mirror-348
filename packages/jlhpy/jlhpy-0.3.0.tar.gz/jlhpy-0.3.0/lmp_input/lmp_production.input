# If a "%" character appears in the restart filename(s), then one file is
# written for each processor and the "%" character is replaced with the
# processor ID from 0 to P-1. An additional file with the "%" replaced by
# "base" is also written, which contains global information. For example,
# the files written on step 1000 for filename restart.% would be
# restart.base.1000, restart.0.1000, restart.1.1000, ..., restart.P-1.1000.
# This creates smaller files and can be a fast mode of output and subsequent
# input on parallel machines that support parallel I/O. The optional fileper
# and nfile keywords discussed below can alter the number of files written.
#
# The restart file can also be written in parallel as one large binary file via
# the MPI-IO library, which is part of the MPI standard for versions 2.0 and
# above. Using MPI-IO requires two steps. First, build LAMMPS with its MPIIO
# package installed [...]
#
# Second, use a restart filename which contains ".mpiio". Note that it does not
# have to end in ".mpiio", just contain those characters. Unlike MPI-IO dump
# files, a particular restart file must be both written and read using MPI-IO.

### Monitor unconstrained forces

# https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_store_force.html
# Store the forces on atoms in the group at the point during each timestep when
# the fix is invoked, as described below. This is useful for storing forces
# before constraints or other boundary conditions are computed which modify the
# forces, so that unmodified forces can be written to a dump file or accessed by
# other output commands that use per-atom quantities.

# This fix is invoked at the point in the velocity-Verlet timestepping
# immediately after pair, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and long-range forces
# have been calculated. It is the point in the timestep when various fixes that
# compute constraint forces are calculated and potentially modify the force on
# each atom. Examples of such fixes are fix shake, fix wall, and fix indent.

# The order in which various fixes are applied which operate at the same point
# during the timestep, is the same as the order they are specified in the input
# script. Thus normally, if you want to store per-atom forces due to force field
# interactions, before constraints are applied, you should list this fix first
# within that set of fixes, i.e. before other fixes that apply constraints.
# However, if you wish to include certain constraints (e.g. fix shake) in the
# stored force, then it could be specified after some fixes and before others.

# Write or read a Gromacs style index file in text format that associates atom
# IDs with the corresponding group definitions. This index file can be used with
# in combination with Gromacs analysis tools or to import group definitions into
# the fix colvars input file. It can also be used to save and restore group
# definitions for static groups.
#
# The group2ndx command will write group definitions to an index file. Without
# specifying any group IDs, all groups will be written to the index file. When
# specifying group IDs, only those groups will be written to the index file. In
# order to follow the Gromacs conventions, the group all will be renamed to
# System in the index file.

# source: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_colvars.html
# This fix interfaces LAMMPS to the collective variables "Colvars" library,
# which allows to calculate potentials of mean force (PMFs) for any set of
# colvars, using different sampling methods: currently implemented are the
# Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) method, metadynamics, Steered Molecular Dynamics
# (SMD) and Umbrella Sampling (US) via a flexible harmonic restraint bias.

# The group-ID entry is ignored. The collective variable module will always
# apply to the entire system and there can only be one instance of the colvars
# fix at a time. The colvars fix will only communicate the minimum information
# necessary and the colvars library supports multiple, completely independent
# collective variables, so there is no restriction to functionality by limiting
# the number of colvars fixes.

# The input keyword allows to specify a state file that would contain the
# restart information required in order to continue a calculation from a
# prerecorded state. Fix colvars records it state in binary restart files, so
# when using the read_restart command, this is usually not needed. The output
# keyword allows to specify the output prefix. All output files generated will
# use this prefix followed by the ".colvars." and a word like "state" or "traj".

# The seed keyword contains the seed for the random number generator that will
# be used in the colvars module.

# The unwrap keyword controls whether wrapped or unwrapped coordinates are
# passed to the colvars library for calculation of the collective variables and
# the resulting forces. The default is yes, i.e. to use the image flags to
# reconstruct the absolute atom positions. Setting this to no will use the
# current local coordinates that are wrapped back into the simulation cell at
# each re-neighboring instead.

# The tstat keyword can be either NULL or the label of a thermostating fix that
# thermostats all atoms in the fix colvars group. This will be used to provide
# the colvars module with the current thermostat target temperature.

# Apply a Langevin thermostat as described in (Schneider) to a group of atoms
# which models an interaction with a background implicit solvent. Used with
# fix nve, this command performs Brownian dynamics (BD), since the total force
# on each atom will have the form:
#
# F = Fc + Ff + Fr
# Ff = - (m / damp) v
# Fr is proportional to sqrt(Kb T m / (dt damp))
#
# Note that unless you use the omega or angmom keywords, the thermostat effect
# of this fix is applied to only the translational degrees of freedom for the
# particles, which is an important consideration for finite-size particles,
# which have rotational degrees of freedom, are being thermostatted. The
# translational degrees of freedom can also have a bias velocity removed
# from them before thermostatting takes place; see the description below.
#
# Unlike the fix nvt command which performs Nose/Hoover thermostatting
# AND time integration, this fix does NOT perform time integration. It
# only modifies forces to effect thermostatting. Thus you must use a
# separate time integration fix, like fix nve to actually update the
# velocities and positions of atoms using the modified forces. Likewise,
# this fix should not normally be used on atoms that also have their
# temperature controlled by another fix - e.g. by fix nvt or fix
# temp/rescale commands.
#
# The damp parameter is specified in time units and determines how rapidly the
# temperature is relaxed. For example, a value of 100.0 means to relax the
# temperature in a timespan of (roughly) 100 time units (tau or fmsec or psec
# - see the units command). The damp factor can be thought of as inversely
# related to the viscosity of the solvent. I.e. a small relaxation time
# implies a hi-viscosity solvent and vice versa. See the discussion about
# gamma and viscosity in the documentation for the fix viscous command for
# more details.

# As with the thermostats, the Nose/Hoover methods (fix npt and fix nph) perform
# time integration. Fix press/berendsen does NOT, so it should be used with one
# of the constant NVE fixes or with one of the NVT fixes.

# In some cases (e.g. for solids) the pressure (volume) and/or temperature of
# the system can oscillate undesirably when a Nose/Hoover barostat and
# thermostat is applied. The optional drag keyword will damp these oscillations,
# although it alters the Nose/Hoover equations. A value of 0.0 (no drag) leaves
# the Nose/Hoover formalism unchanged. A non-zero value adds a drag term; the
# larger the value specified, the greater the damping effect. Performing a short
# run and monitoring the pressure and temperature is the best way to determine
# if the drag term is working. Typically a value between 0.2 to 2.0 is
# sufficient to damp oscillations after a few periods. Note that use of the drag
# keyword will interfere with energy conservation and will also change the
# distribution of positions and velocities so that they do not correspond to the
# nominal NVT, NPT, or NPH ensembles.

# If the linear keyword is used, the linear momentum is zeroed by subtracting

# the relative velocity of any pair of atoms. One or more dimensions can be
# excluded from this operation by setting the corresponding flag to 0.
#
# If the angular keyword is used, the angular momentum is zeroed by subtracting
# a rotational component from each atom.

# This command can be used to insure the entire collection of atoms (or a
# subset of them) does not drift or rotate during the simulation due to random
# perturbations (e.g. fix langevin thermostatting).

# does not alter the dynamics of the system or change the relative coordinates
# of any pair of atoms in the group. This can be used to insure the entire
# collection of atoms (or a portion of them) do not drift during the simulation
# due to random perturbations (e.g. fix langevin thermostatting).
#
# The center-of-mass (COM) is computed for the group specified by the fix.
# If the current COM is different than the specified x,y,z, then a group of
# atoms has their coordinates shifted by the difference. By default the shifted
# group is also the group specified by the fix. A different group can be shifted
# by using the shift keyword. For example, the COM could be computed on a
# protein to keep it in the center of the simulation box. But the entire system
# (protein + water) could be shifted.
#
# Distance units for the x,y,z values are determined by the setting of the units
# keyword, as discussed below. One or more x,y,z values can also be specified
# as NULL, which means exclude that dimension from this operation. Or it can be

# The fix rattle command modifies forces and velocities and thus should be
