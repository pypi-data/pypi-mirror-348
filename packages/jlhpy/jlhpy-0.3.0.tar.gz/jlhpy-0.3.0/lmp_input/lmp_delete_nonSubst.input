# If atom IDs are used, they must all be positive integers. They should also be
# unique, though LAMMPS does not check for this. Typically they should also be
# consecutively numbered (from 1 to Natoms), though this is not required.
# Molecular atom styles are those that store bond topology information (styles
# bond, angle, molecular, full). These styles require atom IDs since the IDs are
# used to encode the topology. Some other LAMMPS commands also require the use
# of atom IDs. E.g. some many-body pair styles use them to avoid double
# computation of the I-J interaction between two atoms.

reset_ids
# Reset atom IDs for the system, including all the global IDs stored for bond,
# angle, dihedral, improper topology data. This will create a set of IDs that
# are numbered contiguously from 1 to N for a N atoms system.

# This can be useful to do after performing a “delete_atoms” command for a
# molecular system. The delete_atoms compress yes option will not perform this
# operation due to the existence of bond topology. It can also be useful to do
# after any simulation which has lost atoms, e.g. due to atoms moving outside a
# simulation box with fixed boundaries (see the “boundary command”), or due to
# evaporation (see the “fix evaporate” command).
