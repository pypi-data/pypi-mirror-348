# The shift keyword can be used to specify an (Sx, Sy, Sz) displacement applied
# to the coordinates of each atom. Sz must be 0.0 for a 2d simulation. This is
# a mechanism for adding structured collections of atoms at different locations
# within the simulation box, to build up a complex geometry. It is up to you to
# insure atoms do not end up overlapping unphysically which would lead to bad
# dynamics. Note that the displace_atoms command can be used to move a subset
# of atoms after they have been read from a data file. Likewise, the
# delete_atoms command can be used to remove overlapping atoms. Note that
# the shift values (Sx, Sy, Sz) are also added to the simulation box
# information (xlo, xhi, ylo, yhi, zlo, zhi) in the data file to shift its
# boundaries. E.g. xlo_new = xlo + Sx, xhi_new = xhi + Sx.
