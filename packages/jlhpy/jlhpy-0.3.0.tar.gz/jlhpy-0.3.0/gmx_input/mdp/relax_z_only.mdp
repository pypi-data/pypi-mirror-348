; Freeze substrate to preserve EAM equilibrated lattice spacing
; freezegrps = Substrate
; freezedim  = Y Y Y ; freeze all three dimensions
; Atoms that belong to a freeze group are kept stationary in the dynamics. This is
; useful during equilibration, e.g. to avoid badly placed solvent molecules giving
; unreasonable kicks to protein atoms, although the same effect can also be
; obtained by putting a restraining potential on the atoms that must be protected.
; The freeze option can be used, if desired, on just one or two coordinates of an
; atom, thereby freezing the atoms in a plane or on a line. When an atom is
; partially frozen, constraints will still be able to move it, even in a frozen
; direction. A fully frozen atom can not be moved by constraints. Many freeze
; groups can be defined. Frozen coordinates are unaffected by pressure scaling; in
; some cases this can produce unwanted results, particularly when constraints are
; also used (in this case you will get very large pressures). Accordingly, it is
; recommended to avoid combining freeze groups with constraints and pressure
; coupling. For the sake of equilibration it could suffice to start with freezing
; in a constant volume simulation, and afterward use position restraints in
; conjunction with constant pressure.

; energygrp-excl = Substrate Substrate
; Pairs of energy groups for which all non-bonded interactions are excluded.
; An example: if you have two energy groups Protein and SOL, specifying
; energygrp-excl = Protein Protein SOL SOL would give only the non-bonded
; interactions between the protein and the solvent. This is especially useful
; for speeding up energy calculations with mdrun -rerun and for excluding
; interactions within frozen groups.
; BUT: Energy group exclusions are not (yet) implemented for the Verlet scheme
