; Note that dispersion correction should be applied in the case of lipid monolayers, but not bilayers.

; Please also note that the switching distance is a matter of some debate in
; lipid bilayer simulations, and it is dependent to some extent on the nature
; of the lipid. Some studies have found that an 0.8-1.0 nm switch is
; appropriate, others argue 0.8-1.2 nm is best, and yet others stand by
; 1.0-1.2 nm. The user is cautioned to thoroughly investigate the force field
; literature for their chosen lipid(s) before beginning a simulation!
