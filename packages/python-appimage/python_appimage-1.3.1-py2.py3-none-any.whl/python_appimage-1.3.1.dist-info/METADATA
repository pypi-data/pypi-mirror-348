# AppImage distributions of Python

_Ready to use AppImages of Python are available as GitHub [releases][RELEASES]._


## Quickstart

We provide relocatable Python runtimes as [AppImages][APPIMAGE] for Linux
systems. These runtimes are extracted from [Manylinux][MANYLINUX] Docker images,
and they are available as GitHub [releases][RELEASES].  Our Python AppImages are
updated weekly, on every Sunday.

Instructions for _installing_ and running _Python AppImages_ are provided on
[Read the Docs][READTHEDOCS].

In addition, the online documentation describes the [`python-appimage`][PYPI]
utility, for application developers. This utility can facilitate the building of
Python apps, given an existing Python AppImage and a recipe folder.
[Examples][APPLICATIONS] of recipes are available from GitHub.


## Projects using [`python-appimage`][GITHUB]

* [grand/python](https://github.com/grand-mother/python) - Contained, portable
  and modern python for [GRAND][GRAND] running from an AppImage
* [rever](https://github.com/regro/rever) - Cross-platform software release tool.
* [ssh-mitm](https://github.com/ssh-mitm/ssh-mitm) - ssh mitm server for security audits
* [xonsh](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh) - Python-powered, cross-platform, Unix-gazing
  shell language and command prompt
* [xxh](https://github.com/xxh/xxh) - Bring your favorite shell wherever you go
  through the ssh


## License

The [`python-appimage`][PYPI] package (**A**) is under the GNU GPLv3 license,
except for files located under `python_appimage/data` which are MIT licensed.
Thus, the produced Manylinux Python AppImages (**B**) are not GPL'd. They
contain a CPython distribution that is (mostly) under the [PSF
license][PSF_LICENSE]. Other parts of **B** (e.g. `AppRun`) are under the MIT
license.
