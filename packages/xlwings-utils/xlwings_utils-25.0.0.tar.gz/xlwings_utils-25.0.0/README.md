## Introduction

This module provides some useful functions to be used in xlwings (lite).

## Installation

Just add xlwings-utils to the *requirements.txt* tab. 

In the script, add

```Ã¬mport xlwings_utils as xwu```

## Dropbox support

The xlwings lite system does not provide access to the local file system. With this module, files can be copied between Dropbox and the local pyodide file system, making it possible to indirectly use the local file system.

It is only possible, as of now, to use full-access Dropbox apps.

The easiest way to use the Dropbox functionality is to add the credentials to the environment variables. Add REFRESH_TOKEN, APP_KEY and APP_SECRET with their corresponding values to the environment variables.

Then, it is possible to list all files in a specified folder with the function `list_dropbox`.
It is also possible to get the folders and to access all underlying folders.

The function `read_dropbox` can be used to read a Dropbox file's contents (bytes).

The function `write_dropbox` can be used to write contents (bytes) to a Dropbox file.

The functions `list_local`, `read_local` and `write_local` offer similar functionality for the local file system (on pyodide).

So, a way to access a file on the system's drive (mapped to Dropbox) as a local file is:

```
contents = xlwings_utils.read_dropbox('/downloads/file1.xls')
xlwings_utils.write_local('file1.xlsx')
df = pandas.read_excel"file1.xlsx")
...
```
And the other direction:
```
contents = xlwings_utils.read_local('file1.gif')
xlwings_utils.write_dropbox('/downloads/file1.gif')
```

## Block support

The module contains a useful 2-dimensional data structure: *block*.
This can be useful to manipulate a range without accessing the range directly, which is expensive in terms of memory and execution time.
The advantage over an ordinary list of lists is that a block is index one-based, in line with range and addressing is done with a row, column tuple.
So, `my_block(lol)[row, col]` is roughly equivalent to `lol[row-1][col-1]`

A block stores the values internally as a dictionary and will only convert these to a list of lists when using `block.value`. 

Converting the value of a range (usually a list of lists, but can also be a list or scalar) to a block can be done with

```
my_block = xwu.block.from_value(range.value)
```
The dimensions (number of rows and number of columns) are automatically set.

Setting of an individual item (one-based, like range) can be done like
```
my_block[row, column] = x
```
And, likewise, reading an individual item can be done like
```
x = my_block[row, column]
```
It is not allowed t,o read or write outside the block dimensions.

It is also possible to define an empty block, like
```
block = xlwings_utils.block(number_of_rows, number_columns)
```
The dimensions can be queried or redefined with `block.number_of_rows` and 
`block.number_of_columns`.

To assign a block to range, use
```
range.value = block.value
```

The property `block.highest_used_row_number` returns the row number of the highest non-None cell.

The property `block.highest_used_column_number` returns the column_number of the highest non-None cell.

The method `block.minimized()` returns a block that has the dimensions of (highest_used_row_number, highest_used_column_number). 

Particularly if we process an unknown number of lines, we can do something like:

```
this_block = xwu.block(number_of_rows=10000, number_of_columns=2)
for row in range(1, 10001):
	this_block[row,1]= ...
	this_block[row,2]= ...
	if ...: # end condition
	    break
sheet.range(10,1).value = this_block.minimized().value
```

In this case, only the really processed rows are copied to the sheet.

## Capture stdout support

The module has support for capturing stdout and -later- using showing the captured output on a sheet.

This is rather important as printing in xlwings lite to the UI pane is rather slow.

In order to capture stdout output, use


```
with xwu.capture:
    """
    code with print statements
    """
```

and then the captured output can be copied to a sheet, like

```
sheet.range(4,5).value = xwu.capture.value
```
Upon reading the value, the capture buffer will be emptied.

If you don't want the buffer to be emptied after accessing the value, use `xwu.capture.value_keep`.

The capture buffer can also be retrieved as a string with `xwu.capture.str` and `xwu.capture.str_keep`.

Clearing the captured stdout buffer can be done at any time with `xwu.capture.clear()`.

Normally, stdout will not be sent to the xlwings lite UI panel when captured with the `xwu.capture` context manager. However, if you specify `xwu.capture.include_print = True`, the output will be sent to the UI panel as well. Note that this setting remains active until a `xwu.capture.include_print = False` is issued.
