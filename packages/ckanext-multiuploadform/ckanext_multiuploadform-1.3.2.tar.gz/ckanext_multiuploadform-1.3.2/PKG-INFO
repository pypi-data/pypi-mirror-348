# ckanext-multiuploadform

This CKAN extension helps users to upload multiple resources at once with drag&drop. It adds an extra form for uploadig multiple files and leaves the vanilla one untouched. 


## Requirements

Compatibility with core CKAN versions:

| CKAN version    | Compatible?   |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| 2.9 and arlier  | not tested    |
| 2.10             | yes    |
| 2.11            | yes    |

* "yes"
* "not tested" - I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't work
* "not yet" - there is an intention to get it working
* "no"


## Installation

To install the extension:

```bash

```

```
3. Add `multiuploadform` to the `ckan.plugins` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   `/etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini`).

```bash

```
