        'description': r"[EN1992-1-1] This guide provides a comprehensive method for calculating the maximum design compressive stress and the design compressive stress at CCT nodes. It explains the relationship between forces acting on the strut and tie, the geometry of the node, and material properties. To illustrate the calculation process, a simple deep beam example is used, offering clear step-by-step instructions. The guide includes key equations, parameter definitions, and practical examples to help users better understand the process of calculating CCT nodes in the strut-and-tie model.",
