It explains how to calculate the basic creep coefficient and drying creep coefficient, and then combine them to determine the total mean creep coefficient. The guide offers step-by-step instructions on how to calculate the creep coefficient, considering factors like concrete age, temperature, and humidity, using specific formulas and parameters defined by Eurocode.",
