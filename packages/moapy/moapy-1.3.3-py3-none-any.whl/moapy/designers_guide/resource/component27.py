        'description': r"[EN1992-1-1] This guide focuses on shear verification for members without design shear reinforcement, following the principles of Eurocode. It provides a comprehensive approach to evaluate shear safety for three section types: reinforced concrete sections, cracked prestressed sections, and support regions, all without shear reinforcement. The verification process considers both the calculated shear resistance and the minimum required shear resistance to ensure safety and compliance with design standards. If the calculated shear safety ratio exceeds the allowable limit, additional design checks for shear reinforcement will be required. This guide aims to help designers ensure that the structural capacity of members relying solely on the concrete section and longitudinal reinforcement is adequately verified.",
