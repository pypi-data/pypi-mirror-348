Bearing resistance is the ability of the soil beneath a foundation to support the applied loads without undergoing shear failure. Calculating this is essential for ensuring that the foundation can safely transfer structural loads to the ground. The guide includes calculations for Ultimate Limit States using three different design approaches, each with specific partial factors applied to structural and geotechnical limit states.",
