The nominal stiffness represents the overall stiffness of members with arbitrary cross sections, considering the contributions of both concrete and steel reinforcements. Once the nominal stiffness is calculated, it is used to determine the critical buckling load, which is the point at which a structural member becomes unstable and buckles. This guide is specifically tailored for statically determinate structures where these methods are applicable, with a particular emphasis on circular cross sections.",
