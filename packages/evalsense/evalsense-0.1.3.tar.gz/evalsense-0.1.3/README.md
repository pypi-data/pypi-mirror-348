## About

This repository holds a Python package enabling systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on open-ended generation tasks, with a particular focus on healthcare and summarisation. It also includes supplementary documentation and assets related to the NHS England project on LLM evaluation, such as the code for an interactive LLM evaluation guide (located in the `guide/` directory). You can find more information about the project in the [original project proposal](https://nhsx.github.io/nhsx-internship-projects/genai-eval/).

_**Note:** Only public or fake data are shared in this repository._

## Project Stucture

- The main code for the EvalSense Python package can be found under [`evalsense/`](https://github.com/nhsengland/evalsense/tree/main/evalsense).
- The accompanying documentation is available in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/nhsengland/evalsense/tree/main/docs) folder.
- Code for the interactive LLM evaluation guide is located under [`guide/`](https://github.com/nhsengland/evalsense/tree/main/guide).
- Jupyter notebooks with the evaluation experiments and examples are located under [`notebooks/`](https://github.com/nhsengland/evalsense/tree/main/notebooks).

## Getting Started

## Installation
You can install the project using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) by running the following command:

```bash
pip install evalsense
```

This will install the latest released version of the package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/evalsense/).

Depending on your use-case, you may want to install additional optional dependencies from the following groups:
* `interactive`: For running experiments interactively in Jupyter notebooks (only needed if you don't already have the necessary libraries installed).
* `transformers`: For using models and metrics requiring the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library.
* `vllm`: For using models and metrics requiring [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/).
* `local`: For installing all local model dependencies (currently includes `transformers` and `vllm`).
* `all`: For installing all optional dependencies.

For example, if you want to use EvalSense with Jupyter notebooks (`interactive`) and Hugging Face Transformers (`transformers`), you can run:

```bash
pip install evalsense[interactive,transformers]
```

### Installation for Development

To install the project for local development, you can follow the steps below:

To clone the repo:

`git clone git@github.com:nhsengland/evalsense.git`

To setup the Python environment for the project:

- Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) if it's not installed already
- `uv sync --all-extras`
- `source .venv/bin/activate`
- `pre-commit install`

To setup the Node environment for the LLM evaluation guide (located under [`guide/`](https://github.com/nhsengland/evalsense/tree/main/guide)):

- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) if it's not installed already
- Change to the `guide/` directory (`cd guide`)
- `npm install`
- `npm run start` to run the development server

See also the separate [README.md](https://github.com/nhsengland/evalsense/tree/main/guide/README.md) for the guide.

## Usage

For an example illustrating the usage of EvalSense, please check the [Demo notebook](https://github.com/nhsengland/evalsense/blob/main/notebooks/Demo.ipynb) under the `notebooks/` folder.
