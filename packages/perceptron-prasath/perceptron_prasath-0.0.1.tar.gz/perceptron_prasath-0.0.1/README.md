A simple implementation of the Perceptron algorithm using only Python and NumPy. This notebook demonstrates the foundational concepts behind binary classification through a hands-on example using the AND logic gate.

üß† What is a Perceptron?
The Perceptron is one of the earliest types of artificial neural networks, used for binary classifiers. It performs classification by computing a weighted sum of inputs and applying an activation function.
