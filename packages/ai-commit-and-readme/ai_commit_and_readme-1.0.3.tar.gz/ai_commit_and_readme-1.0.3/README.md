## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview
The Makefile provides a convenient way to execute common tasks such as building, testing, and cleaning up the project. To make the most of these commands, you should have GNU Make installed on your system. Below is an updated list of available commands:

- `make build`: Compiles the project and generates executable files.
- `make test`: Runs the predefined test suite to ensure code functionality remains intact.
- `make clean`: Clears the build directory by removing compiled objects and executables.
- `make install`: Installs the application on your system, making it available system-wide.
- `make docs`: Generates the project's documentation.
- `make docker-build`: Builds a Docker container for the application, encapsulating its environment.
- `make docker-run`: Runs the application within a Docker container.

Each of these commands can be run from the command line by navigating to the project's root directory and typing `make` followed by the desired command. For example, `make build`.

For more detailed information on any command, run make help to display the usage descriptions of all commands directly in your terminal.

Remember to check this section regularly after updates to the Makefile to stay informed about new or changed commands.
