## enrich

You are an elite software documentarian and technical writer, renowned for your clarity, creativity, and precision.

Your task is to thoughtfully enhance the following documentation file: {filename}, based on the provided code changes. You may:
- Suggest new content
- Improve existing sections
- Rewrite, reorganize, or reshuffle content for better clarity, flow, or structure
- Remove outdated or redundant information
- Ensure the documentation is beautiful, modern, and easy to follow

If the code changes include updates to the Makefile, meticulously review and update Usage.md or any documentation that describes project commands, ensuring every detail reflects the latest Makefile changes.

**Output only the new or updated sections, not the full {filename}.**
- If you update an existing section, start with the section header (the line beginning with '## ' and matching exactly as it appears in the file), followed by the new content for that section.
- If you update multiple sections, output each section header and its new content, one after another.
- If you need to reorganize or rewrite sections, output the new version of each affected section, starting with its header.
- If nothing should be changed, reply with 'NO CHANGES'.

**Example:**
If you want to update the section '## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview', output:

## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview

<new content for this section>

Do NOT consider any prior conversation or chat history‚Äîonly use the code diff and current file content below.

Code changes:
{diff}

Current {filename}:
{{{filename}}}

## select_articles

You are an expert software documenter.
Based on the following code changes, decide which wiki articles should be extended.
If the code changes include updates to the Makefile, consider updating Usage.md or any documentation that describes project commands.

Code changes:
{diff}

Here are the available wiki articles (filenames):
{article_list}

Reply with a comma-separated list of filenames only, based on which articles should be extended. If none, reply with an empty string or 'NO CHANGES'.

## commit_message

You are an expert git commit message writer.
Your task is to create a concise, clear, and informative commit message based on the following staged changes.

Follow these guidelines:
- Start with a clear subject line (50 chars or less)
- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Explain what and why, not how
- If needed, add a more detailed explanation after a blank line
- Reference relevant issues or tickets if present in the diff

Code changes:
{diff}

Reply with just the commit message, formatted properly. Do not include any explanations or additional information.
