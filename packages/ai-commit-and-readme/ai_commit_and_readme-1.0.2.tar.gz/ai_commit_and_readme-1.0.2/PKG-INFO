## 🛠️ Makefile Commands Overview
The `Makefile` provided with this project simplifies many of the common tasks required to manage the software lifecycle. To use the Makefile, ensure you have `make` installed on your system and from the project root directory, invoke the following commands as needed:

- `make build`: Compiles the project, targeting the default configuration.
- `make test`: Runs the suite of unit tests to ensure the project's reliability.
- `make install`: Installs the project binaries and resources onto your system.
- `make clean`: Removes all generated files and cleans up the build environment.
- `make docker-build`: Creates a Docker image for the project, encapsulating it within a container for easy distribution or deployment.
- `make docker-push`: Pushes the built Docker image to a registry, defaulting to Docker Hub.
- `make deploy`: Deploys the project to the specified target environment, assuming deployment scripts are properly set up.
- `make all`: Executes the build, test, and install commands consecutively.

Note: Some commands may have prerequisites or require additional environment setup. Consult the dedicated sections of this README or the accompanying documentation for more details on each command.
