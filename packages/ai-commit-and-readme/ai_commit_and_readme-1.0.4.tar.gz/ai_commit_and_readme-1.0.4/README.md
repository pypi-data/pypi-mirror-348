## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview
In our continuous effort to streamline the development process, we've made several updates to our Makefile to enhance usability and efficiency. Below, you will find the updated commands that are essential for building, running, and testing our software suite.

- `make build`: This command now benefits from improved dependency tracking, ensuring that only changed files are recompiled, saving time and computational resources.
- `make run`: We've introduced new environment variables that you can set to customize the runtime behavior of our applications. Detailed instructions on how to use these variables can be found in the section '## üöÄ Running the Application'.
- `make test`: In addition to running all predefined tests, this command now automatically generates a coverage report. It's crucial for maintaining the high quality of our codebase by checking that all new code is adequately tested.
- `make clean`: Use this command to remove all generated files and clean your workspace. It now also clears any residual data or logs that might interfere with a fresh build.

Remember, every command is crafted to help you focus more on developing great software less on the repetitive tasks.
