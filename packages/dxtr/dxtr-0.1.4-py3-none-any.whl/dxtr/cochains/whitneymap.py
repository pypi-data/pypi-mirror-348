    Attributes
    ----------
    base : np.ndarray of float
        (Nfk*Nn, (D,)*k)-array containing the Whitney forms 
        for each couple (n-simplex, k-face), see Notes.
    positions : np.ndarray of float
        (Nn, D)-array containing the position vectors of the circumcenters
        of all the Nn top simplices of the considered n-complex.
    
    Notes
    -----
    * A Whitney k-map, as we envision it here, is the collection of all base 
      k-forms interpolated at the circumcenter of each n-simplex of 
      a simplicial complex/manifold.
    * Each base k-form is the interpolation of the base function associated 
      to a k-simplex. Since a k-simplex (k<n) is shared by several 
      n-simplices, we have one interpolation of each base k-form on each 
      of those.
    * About the shape of the attribute *base*: 
      * Each top simplex is surrounded by Nfk k-faces. We compute 
        a Whitney k-form for each of these k faces, specific to each top 
        simplex. Therefore we compute Nfk*Nn Whitney k-forms in total 
        (Nn being the number of n-simplices).
      * We depict a k-form as a k-degree anti-symmetric tensor in a space 
        of dimension D. 1-forms are encoded as Dd vectors, i.e. (D,)-arrays;
        2-forms as D*D matrices, i.e. (D,D)-arrays -> generalization: 
        k-forms are encoded as (D,..D)-arrays, D being repeated k times. 
        We noted this (D,)*k in the attribute description.
