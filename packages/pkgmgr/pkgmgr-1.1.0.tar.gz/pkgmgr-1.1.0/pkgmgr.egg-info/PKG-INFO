A repeatable and self-documenting OS package manager.

A wannabe [nixos](https://nixos.org/) and [aconfmgr](https://github.com/CyberShadow/aconfmgr), `pkgmgr` aims to bring declarative package management to your systemâ€”without the intrusiveness or complexity of NixOS. Manage your system configuration and installed packages in a reproducible, version-controlled way.

## Features

- Declarative package management
- Less intrusive than NixOS
- Inspired by tools like aconfmgr

## Examples

1. Get differences between system state and saved config

  </div>


2. Apply the changes to make system state match the saved config
