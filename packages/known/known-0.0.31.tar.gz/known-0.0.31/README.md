# ðŸ§© known.Mailer


* Use gmail account to send mails from within your python code.

* Use `Mail` static method to send mail which requires username and password
    * username must be a gmail address from which mail will be sent 
    * password can be either one of:
        * google (account) password
        * app password

* Its recomended to use app password, to generate one visit 
    * https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

* App passwords requires enabling 2-step verification first, to enable it visit
    * https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/twosv


* On the reciver side, incoming mails will be usually treated as spam and must be marked as 'not spam' at least once

* Note: Implements sending functionality only, cannot read emails.

Usage:

```
known.Mailer.Mail(
    username = "sender@gmail.com",     # sender's userid - must be @gmail 
    password = "aaa bbb ccc ddd",      # sender's password - use app password
    Subject = "this is the subject line", 
    To = "person1@domain1.com,person2@domain2.com",  # csv list of email addresses
    Cc = "person3@domain3.com,person4@domain4.com",  # csv list of email addresses
    Body = "this is the body of the message", 
    Attached = ['attach.txt', '/home/attach.pdf'], # python list of attached files
    )

```

## Functionality

#### 1. Create a new image

* creates new images of given size and color 

* args is (int) 7-tuple (height, width, channels, blue, green, red, alpha)
    * `--args=h,w,c,b,g,r,a`

* fill-color (blue, green, red, alpha) depends on the specified number of channels
    * `--args=h,w,4,b,g,r,a`
    * `--args=h,w,3,b,g,r`
    * `--args=h,w,1,i`                  

Example - creating 32 x 64 image with 4 channels named 'new.jpg'
```
python -m known.pix --action=new --args=32,64,4,100,150,200,170 --output=new.jpg
```

#### 2. Crop an image

* crops an image using bounding box (y, x, h, w) 

* args is (int) 4-tuple (y-coord, x-coord, height, width) indicating a bounding box
    * `--args=y,x,h,w`

Example - 
```
python -m known.pix --action=crop --args=8,16,16,32 --input=new.jpg --output=cropped.jpg
```

#### 3. Extend an image

* extends an image using boundary distance 

* args is (int) 8-tuple (north, south, east, west, blue, green, red, alpha)
    * `--args=n,s,e,w,b,g,r,a`

* fill-color (blue, green, red, alpha) depends on the specified number of channels
    * `--args=n,s,e,w,b,g,r,a`
    * `--args=n,s,e,w,b,g,r`    
    * `--args=n,s,e,w,i`

Example - 
```
python -m known.pix --action=extend --args=10,5,6,12,123,123,0,100 --input=new.jpg --output=extended.jpg
```


#### 4. Flip an image

* flip an image (horizontally, vertically)

* args is (int) 2-tuple (horizontally, vertically) 

    * Flip horizontally          `--args=1,0`
    * Flip vertically            `--args=0,1`
    * Flip corners               `--args=1,1`
    * Flip nothing               `--args=0,0`

Example - 
```
python -m known.pix --action=flip --args=1,1 --input=extended.jpg --output=flipped.jpg
```

#### 5. Rotate an image

* rotate an image (clockwise or couter-clockwise)

* args is (int) 1-tuple (clockwise) 
    
    * Rotate clockwise               `--args=1`
    * Rotate counter-clockwise       `--args=0`

Example - 
```
python -m known.pix --action=rotate --args=1 --input=flipped.jpg --output=rotated.jpg
```

#### 6. Convert an image to a format

* converts between image formats *(as per output)*

* args is not used, target file type is infered from the output file extension

Example - 
```
python -m known.pix --action=convert --input=rotated.jpg --output=rotated.png
```

#### 7. Convert an image to multiple formats

* converts between image formats *(as per args)*

* args is (str) n-tuple specifying the extensions to be converted to

* output filenames are not used, the file-names are taken from input files

* the extensions are added as specified in args

* e.g., Convert png to jpg and webp      `--input=input.png --args=jpg,webp`
the output files will be `input.png` and `input.webp`

Example - 
```
python -m known.pix --action=autoconvert --input=rotated.png --args=jpeg,webp
```

# ðŸ§© known.fly

Flask based web app for sharing files and quiz evaluation

## Quickstart

* Install the required dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install Flask Flask-WTF waitress nbconvert 
```

* Start the server

```bash
python -m known.fly
```

* If the server was started for the first time (or config file was not found), a new config file `__configs__.py` will be created inside the **workspace directory**. It will contain the default configuration. In such a case the server will not start and the process is terminated with following output

```bash
â‡’ Server will not start on this run, edit the config and start again
```

* One can edit this configuration file and start the server again. config file includes various options described as follows:

```python

                                            #   (if case>0 uids are converted to upper-case when matching in database)
                                            #   (if case<0 uids are converted to lower-case when matching in database)

    board        = "board.ipynb",     # board file (public read-only, a notebook displayed as a web-page)
```

* Additional Arguments can be passed while launching the server as follows:
```bash
python -m known.fly --help

usage: fly.py [-h] [--dir DIR] [--verbose VERBOSE] [--log LOG] [--con CON] [--reg REG] [--cos COS] [--coe COE] [--access ACCESS] [--msl MSL] [--eip EIP]

  --dir DIR          path of workspace directory [DEFAULT]: current diretory
  --verbose VERBOSE  verbose level in logging (0,1,2) [DEFAULT]: 2
  --log LOG          name of logfile as date-time-formated string, blank by default [Note: keep blank to disable logging]
  --con CON          config name (refers to a dict in __configs__.py - if not provided, uses 'default'
  --reg REG          if specified, allow users to register with that access string such as DABU or DABUS+
  --cos COS          use 1 to create-on-start - create (overwrites) pages [DEFAULT]: 1

  --msl MSL          Max String Length for UID/NAME/PASSWORDS [DEFAULT]: 100
  --eip EIP          Evaluate Immediate Persis. If True (by-default), persist the eval-db after each single evaluation (eval-db in always persisted after update from template)
```

## Notes

* **Sessions** :
    * `known.fly` uses only `http` protocol and not `https`. Sessions are managed on server-side. The location of the file containing the `secret` for flask app can be specified in the `__configs__.py` script. If not specified i.e., left blank, it will auto generate a random secret. Generating a random secret every time means that the users will not remain logged in if the server is restarted.

* **Database** :
    * The database of users is fully loaded and operated from RAM, therefore the memory usage depends on the number of registered users.
    * The offline database is stored in `csv` format and provides no security or ACID guarantees. The database is loaded when the server starts and is committed back to disk when the server stops. This means that if the app crashes, the changes in the database will not reflect. 
    * Admin users can manually **persist** (`!`) the database to disk and **reload** (`?`) it from the disk using the `/x/?` url.

* **Admin Commands** :
    * Admin users can issue commands through the `/x` route as follows:
        * Check admin access:        `/x`
        * Persist database to disk:  `/x?!`
        * Reload database from disk: `/x??`
        * Enable/Disable Uploads:    `/x?~`
        * Refresh Download List:     `/downloads??`
        * Refresh Board:             `/board??`

    * User-Related: 

        * Create a user with uid=`uid` and name=`uname`: 
            * `/x/uid?name=uname&access=DABU`
        * Reset Password for uid=`uid`:
            * `/x/uid`
        * Change name for uid=`uid`:
            * `/x/uid?name=new_name`
        * Change access for uid=`uid`:
            * `/x/uid?access=DABUSRX`
        

* **Access Levels** :
    * The access level of a user is specified as a string containing the following permissions:
        * `D`   Access Downloads
        * `A`   Access Store
        * `B`   Access Board
        * `U`   Perform Upload
        * `S`   Access Self Uploads
        * `R`   Access Reports
        * `X`   Eval access enabled
        * `-`   Not included in evaluation
        * `+`   Admin access enabled
    * The access string can contain multiple permissions and is specified in the `ADMIN` column of the `login.csv` file.

    * Note: Evaluators (with `X` access) cannot perform any admin actions except for resetting password through the `/x` url.

* **Store Actions** : `store/subpath?`
    * Create Folder : `store/subpath/my_folder??` (Only if not existing)
    * Delete Folder : `store/subpath/my_folder?!` (Recursive Delete)
    * Download File : `store/subpath/my_file?get`
    * Delete File   : `store/subpath/my_file?del`


* **App Routes** : All the `@app.route` are listed as follows:
    * Login-Page: `/`
    * Register-Page: `/new`
    * Logout and redirect to Login-Page: `/logout`
    * Home-Page: `/home`
    * Downloads-Page: `/downloads`
    * Reports-Page: `/reports`
    * Self-Uploads-Page: `/uploads`
    * Refresh Self-Uploads list and redirect to Home-Page: `/uploadf`
    * Delete all Self-Uploads and redirect to Home-Page: `/purge`
    * Store-Page (public): `/store`
    * User-Store-Page (evaluators): `/storeuser`
    * Enable/Disable hidden files in stores: `/hidden_show`
    * Evaluation-Page: `/eval`
    * Generate and Download a template for bulk evaluation: `/generate_eval_template`
    * Generate and View user reports: `/generate_submit_report`
    * Board-Page: `/board`
    * Admin-Access (redirects to Evalution-Page): `/x`


## Issue Tracking

#### [ 1 ] mistune version 3.1

* Reported: (Python3.10, ARM.aarch64)

* Error: The board file is not converted from `.ipynb` to `.html` even when `nbconvert` package is installed. 
```
AttributeError: 'MathBlockParser' object has no attribute 'parse_axt_heading'. Did you mean: 'parse_atx_heading'?
```

* Solution: use mistune version lower than `3.1` - find one at [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mistune/#history)
```bash
python -m pip install mistune==3.0.2
```
