Installation
============

You can simply use pip:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install phoneshift


Phoneshift is a "connected module":
First, you have to provide an API token in the environement variables that you obtain through `the phoneshift website <https://phoneshift.ing>`_, ex.:

.. code-block:: shell

   export PHONESHIFT_API_TOKEN=api_us6sc7lmd6preubeol4Sm95Yqe40wyhh

Then, you can run some python code, ex.:

.. code-block:: shell

   python -c 'import phoneshift; print(phoneshift.__version__)'

when loading the module with ``import phoneshift``, the API token will be checked through the network and thus validate your usage license.
This validation happens when the module is loading, in the background, thus minimizing any delay before audio processing.

.. note::

   **No audio** stream will be passed to phoneshift servers. 100% of the processing is done locally on your machine.
   Network connectivity is only used to validate the API token and send very light usage statistics that help setting priorities of phoneshift's development.

Testing
-------

To verify that everything is setup properly, you can run the tests provided with the module:

.. code-block:: shell

   python -c 'import phoneshift.tests; phoneshift.tests.run()'

This runs very simple regression tests and smoke tests.

This command does *not* run regressions tests on audio processing, as they are too heavy to be shiped with the python module.
