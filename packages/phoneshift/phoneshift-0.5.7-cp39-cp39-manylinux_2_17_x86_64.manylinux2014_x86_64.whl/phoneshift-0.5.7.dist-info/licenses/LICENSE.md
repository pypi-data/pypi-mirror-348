## 2. Agreement

When you use our Products, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision.

The Company grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Products for your personal or business purposes.

These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.

If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account, without notice and without compensation.

## 3. Account, Ownership and Legal Responsibility

A Phoneshift account is owned by an individual, not by an organization. When you sign up and create a Phoneshift account, you are the owner of that account.

By default, our legal responsibility is to the account owner, so we won't let other people take over your account without your permission.

However, if you own an account for the sole purpose of a work of an organisation (a company, a society, an association, a fondation, etc.), our legal responsibility is to the organisation. Upon reception of the necessary document provided by your organisation, we might transfer your account without your permission.

Please create a separate account for each legal entity you work with.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

Accounts cannot be registered by "bots" or other automated methods. If such an account is detected, it will be automatically suspended, canceled and deleted without notice, without providing any reason and without compensation.

### 3.1 Start and end dates

The Start date is the date when you created your account on the Website.

The End date is the date when your account has been cancelled (no matter how it has been cancelled).

### 3.2 Suspension, Cancellation and Deletion

Suspension means you and any other linked users will not be able to access the account or use any Product. You might re-enable your subscription within 6 months. Past this delay, and if you do not loggin within this period, your Account will be scheduled for cancellation.

Cancelled means a suspension, and, the account is no longer accessible.
You and any other linked users will not be able to access the account or use any Product. Otherwise your Account will be deleted.

Besides automatic cancellation due to inactivity, you are responsible for properly cancelling your account.

If you need help cancelling your account, you can always reach us at <support@phoneshift.ing>

If you only cancel your payment method before the end of your current paid up period, you will not be charged again and the Products will become unusable at the end of your current paid up period.

However, if you cancel your account before the end of your current paid up period, the Products will be suspended **immediatly**. We do not automatically prorate unused time in the last billing period. TODO prorate

If you canceled your payment method and you do not login on to the Webiste within 6 months, your account will be automatically cancelled.

After cancellation (no matter how it was canceled), within 30 days, all content will be permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 60 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.

There are three exceptions to the retention periods described above:

* Tax and other administrative laws might force us to keep some data for up to 18 months. We will always do our best to delete this type of information as soon as possible as it has absolutely no value for us.

* Data that has any value for handling any dispute or litigation might be held as long as necessary (see Sec. 8.5).

* Fully anonimyzed information (see Sec. 8.4).

If you do not have login credentials but do have legal authority to manage someone's affairs, please cancel the associated credit cards. This will automatically suspend the Account and then delete it.

### 3.3 Termination

We have the right to cancel and delete your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Products for any reason at any time.

We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Products to anyone for any reason at any time. 

We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of thousands accounts, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, please see Sec. 10.

Upon cancelation, you must immediately cease using our Products.

## 4. Billing and payments

Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites.

Due to the nature of the product, the Company does not offer refunds. If you truly believe you are owed a refund, you can contact us at <support@phoneshift.ing>

At the end of any free trial period you may be using, either of the two will happen:

* The account will be charged according to the user's chosen subscription.

* The account will not be charged and the subscription will be suspended until upgraded to a paid version.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.

Nevertheless, for any day that has shown any significant down time, we will do our best to offer one day for free to all customers impacted by the down time.

We obviously keep the right in the interpretation of "significant" and "impacted".
