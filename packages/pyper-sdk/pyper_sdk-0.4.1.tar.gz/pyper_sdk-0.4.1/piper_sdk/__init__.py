"""
Piper SDK Package.

This file marks the directory 'piper_sdk' as a Python package,
allowing modules within it (like client.py) to be imported.

# Optionally, you can make classes/functions available directly when importing piper_sdk
# For example:
# from .client import PiperClient, PiperAuthError, PiperConfigError

# However, it's often clearer to require users to import explicitly:
# from piper_sdk.client import PiperClient
