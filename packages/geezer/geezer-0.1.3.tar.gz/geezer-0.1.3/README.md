## What is Geezer?

Geezer is a tiny Python logging helper that makes print-style debugging stylish, readable, and safe for dev environments.

Perfect for:
- Teaching or explaining complex code
- Debugging step-by-step logic
- Visual learners or neurodivergent-friendly workflows
- Looking good in the terminal 😎

It hides noise in production — unless you say otherwise.

---

## 🖥️ Terminal Support

Geezer looks best in terminals that support:

- **UTF-8** (for emoji output)
- **ANSI colors** (used by [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich))

✅ Recommended:
- Windows Terminal  
- macOS Terminal or iTerm2  
- Any modern Linux terminal  

⚠️ *Note:* PyCharm's terminal or legacy consoles may not render colors or emojis properly. Use an external terminal for full effect.

```

### 🧠 Log history
```python
from geezer import get_log_history

for entry in get_log_history():
    print(entry["timestamp"], entry["message"])
```

### 🤖 Auto-tagging

## ✨ Features

### 🟡 `warn()`
```python
warn("User has no saved card", "user check")
```

### ⏱️ `timer()`
```python
with timer("checkout process"):
    run_checkout()
```

### 🧠 Log history
```python
from geezer import get_log_history

logs = get_log_history()
for entry in logs:
    print(entry["timestamp"], entry["message"])
```

### 🤖 Auto-emoji
Enable auto-tagging:
```python
import geezer.log
geezer.log.auto_tagging = True
```

Now this:
```python
log("API call failed due to timeout")
```

Becomes:
```text
[❌ error] API call failed due to timeout
```

---

## Config

By default, `geezer` only prints in dev:
```env
DJANGO_DEBUG=True
```

Or override manually with `"ok"` as the last argument.

---

## Why “Geezer”?

Because sometimes the old ways are the best.  
Geezer gives you raw, readable feedback — with zero setup, and max personality.

## Roadmap

- [x] Console styling with `rich`  
- [x] Utility functions (`warn`, `timer`)  
- [x] Emoji + label tagging  
- [x] In-memory log history  
- [x] Auto emoji detection  
- [ ] File logging  
- [ ] Timestamp prefix toggle  
- [ ] Custom output backends (file, webhook, etc)  
- [ ] `geeze()` alias just for fun

Pull up a chair.  
Throw in a `prnt()` or `log()`.  
Talk to yourself a little.

You earned it, geezer.
