class FileLock():
    """
    Manages system-wide exclusive file locks for given lock keys.

    A FileLock ensures that certain operations are performed synchronously across system boundaries by creating a file and 
    applying a system-wide lock to it. This lock remains active until it is explicitly released or the program exits, 
    preventing other programs from acquiring the same lock.

    This implementation supports managing multiple locks concurrently. By providing multiple lock keys, the FileLock class 
    will attempt to acquire the first available lock from the provided pool. For example, to restrict a process to run 
    only 4 instances simultaneously, you can provide 4 different lock keys.
