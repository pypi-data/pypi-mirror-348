# Sentieon's vcflib
An open-source Python library for parsing and manipulation of variant call
format (VCF) files.

## Highlights
- Transparently supports reading and writing uncompressed or bgzip-compressed
  and tabix-indexed VCF files.
- VCF and gVCF (with the `.g.vcf.gz` suffix) files are supported.
- Output files write tribble (`.vcf.idx`) and tabix (`vcf.gz.tbi`) indexes on
  the fly, without a separate pass through the data for indexing.
- Parallelization across genomic regions is supported with a `Sharder` class.
- Support for Python2.7 and Python3.

## Example Usuage - VCF filtering
A simple script that filters variants with a DP < 10 from an input VCF is
provided as an example at `example/filter_dp.py`.

```
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python example/filter_dp.py --input_vcf <VCF> --output_vcf <VCF>
```
