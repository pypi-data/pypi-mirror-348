# D-OSTS (RHESSI Group Project)
## Overview

This project focuses on modeling the re-entry trajectory of a satellite currently in a deteriorating orbit around Earth. As atmospheric drag significantly influences its path near perigee, the satellite has become uncontrollable. Ground-based radar stations are monitoring its position periodically. The primary objective is to predict the potential impact location of the satellite upon re-entry.
