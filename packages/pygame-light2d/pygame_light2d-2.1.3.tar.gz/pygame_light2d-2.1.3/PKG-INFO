## Getting started

To learn how to create a simple game with lighting effects using `pygame-light2d`, check out the [Getting started](https://github.com/MarkelZ/pygame-light2d/wiki/Getting-Started) page on the wiki.

## Documentation

### Using the API

For detailed explanations of the API, please refer to the [API Reference](https://github.com/MarkelZ/pygame-light2d/wiki/API-Reference).

### Using `pygame-light2d` in an existing project

If you're looking to incorporate `pygame-ligth2d` into an existing project, we recommend starting with our guide on [Adding lights to an existing project](https://github.com/MarkelZ/pygame-light2d/wiki/Adding-lights-to-an-existing-project).

## Graphics engine

This package uses [pygame-render](https://github.com/MarkelZ/pygame-render) for
using shaders in `pygame`, and it can be accessed with `LightingEngine.graphics`.
