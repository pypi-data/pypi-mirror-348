# Tips for Evaluation


## LLM-as-a-Judge

*You should use valid prompts for the LLM-as-a-Judge method.*

Case1:

When using the following prompts, empty prediction sometimes scored as 5.
```
# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by AI models.
We will provide you with the user prompt and an AI-generated responses.
You should first read the user prompt carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on and rules provided in the Evaluation section below.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing question answering quality, which measures the overall quality of the answer to the question in the user prompt. Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences. The instruction for performing a question-answering task is provided in the user prompt. The response should not contain information that is not present in the context (if it is provided).

You will assign the writing response a score from 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.
Give step-by-step explanations for your scoring, and only choose scores from 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

## Criteria Definition
Instruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the question answering task instructions, satisfying all of the instruction's requirements.
Groundedness: The response contains information included only in the context if the context is present in the user prompt. The response does not reference any outside information.
Completeness: The response completely answers the question with sufficient detail.
Fluent: The response is well-organized and easy to read.

## Rating Rubric
5: (Very good). The answer follows instructions, is grounded, complete, and fluent.
4: (Good). The answer follows instructions, is grounded, complete, but is not very fluent.
3: (Ok). The answer mostly follows instructions, is grounded, answers the question partially and is not very fluent.
2: (Bad). The answer does not follow the instructions very well, is incomplete or not fully grounded.
1: (Very bad). The answer does not follow the instructions, is wrong and not grounded.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Assess the response in aspects of instruction following, groundedness,completeness, and fluency according to the criteria.
STEP 2: Provide overall score based on the rubric in the format of `Score: X` where X is the score you assign to the response.

# Question, Reference Answer and AI-generated Response
## Question
{input_text}

## Reference Answer
{answer}

## AI-generated Response
{pred}
```

When using the above prompts, the following combinations of (question, answer, pred) were scored as [5, 1, 5]. Ideally, a score of [1, 1, 1] should be given.

```
questions = [“前年の合計所得が33万円以下の世帯の場合、軽減の割合は何割ですか。\n解答は数量のみで答えてください。“, “3つのラベルはどのような違いがありますか。\n解答は自由に記述してください。“, “国内の日本語教育の概要において、外国人に対する日本語教育の現状として、日本語教師数の数や学習者の数はどうなっていますか。\n解答は自由に記述してください。“]
answers = [“7割です“, “下部に文字がプリントされているかどうか、プリントの内容が「CARBONNEUTRAL」または「CERTIFIEDMODEL」かの違いがあります。“, “国内の日本語教育の概要において、外国人に対する日本語教育の現状として、日本語教師数の数は34392人、学習者の数は139613人となっています。“]
preds = [“”, “”, “”]

# scores: [5, 1, 5]
```

When the order of the answer and pred in the instruction prompt was reversed, they were correctly scored as [1,1,1]. This suggests that Judger may not be able to clearly distinguish between answer and pred when using the above prompt. The instruction prompts should be modified to clearly distinguish between “answer” and “pred”.
