# hikari-nya

A bunch of little utilities i gathered around or made when using [hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) and wished it was reusable. This may grow into something bigger but for now it's that :3

Perhaps some of theese things will work with any hikari-based project, but i plan most to be specifically made with [miru](https://github.com/hypergonial/hikari-miru) or [arc](https://github.com/hypergonial/hikari-arc) (go check them out, they're really cool!)
