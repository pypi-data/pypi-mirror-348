"""
Abstract interface for IO

This currently only targets the merge function in the portmod/merge.py file via the
MergeIO abstract class, and install_pkg via InstallIO (install_pkg gets called by
merge, but shouldn't be invoked by itself).

To use, call merge(..., io=my_merge_io), passing an object from a class which
implements MergeIO as my_merge_io.
