    The class all Pybuilds should derive.

    The name and path of a pybuild declares the package name, category, version and
    (optionally) revision::

        {CATEGORY}/{PKG_NAME}-{VER}(-r{REV}).pybuild

    Categories and package names may contain lower case letters, numbers and hyphens.
    Versions may contain numbers and dots. Revisions may only contain numbers
    (following the -r prefix). (See the PMS for the complete naming scheme).

    Note that revisions refer to revisions of the pybuild itself, not the package,
    and are used to indicate that the way the mod is configured has changed in a way
    that will impact the installed version. For changes, such as the source files
    moving, that would not impact a mod that is already installed, you do not need to
    update the revision.

    There are certain fields which are defined automatically and may only be available
    in some scopes:

    DEPEND = ""
    """
    Build dependencies.

    The DEPEND field is used to specify packages which need to be installed in order
    for this package to install correctly.

    Most mods do not have build dependencies, however mods that require patching using
    tools external to portmod, or packages that generate content from other sources,
    will need to include their masters, or the other sources, as build dependencies,
    to ensure that they are installed prior to the package being installed.

    Format (both ``DEPEND`` and ``RDEPEND``):
    A list of dependencies in the form of package atoms. All dependencies should
    include both category and package name. Versions should also be included if
    the package depends on a specific version of another mod.
    It is recommended not to include a version number in the dependency unless it is
    known that the package will not work with other versions.

    Ranges of versions can be indicated by prefixing >,<,<=,>= to the atoms.
    E.g. ``>=cat/foo-1.0``

    Specific versions can be indicated by prefixing ``=`` (matches version and
    revision exactly) or ``~`` (matches version, but allows any revision) to the atoms.
    E.g. ``=cat/foo-1.0``

    Use flag dependencies can be specified in the following manner:

    - ``cat/foo[flag]`` - Indicates that flag must be enabled
    - ``cat/foo[flag,flag2]`` - Indicates that both flag and flag2 must be enabled
    - ``cat/foo[-flag]`` - Indicates that flag must be disabled
    - ``cat/foo[flag?]`` - Indicates that flag must be enabled if it is enabled for
      this package
    - ``cat/foo[!flag?]`` - Indicates that flag must be disabled if it is enabled for
      this package

    Atoms can be surrounded by use-conditionals if they are only dependencies when
    that use flag is enabled/disabled.

    E.g. ``flag? ( cat/foo )``

    Atoms can be grouped and prefixed by a ``||`` operator to indicate that any of the
    given packages will satisfy the dependency.

    E.g. ``|| ( cat/foo cat/bar cat/baz )``

    Note that it is required that the parentheses ``(`` ``)`` are separated from the atoms
    by whitespace.

    Packages which cannot be installed at the same time can be marked as blocks using the
    ``!!`` operator. I.e. ``!!cat/foo`` indicates that ``cat/foo`` cannot be installed at
    the same time as the current package.
    """

    RDEPEND = ""
    """
    Runtime dependencies.

    Is used to specify packages which are required at runtime for this package
    to function. The format is the same as for DEPEND
    """
    IUSE = ""
    """
    A field containing a space-separated list of the use flags used by the package.

    IUSE should contain all regular use flags used by this package, both local and
    global. Prefixing the use flags with a + means that the option is enabled by
    default. Otherwise use flags are disabled by default.

    Note that you do not need to include TEXTURE_SIZES type flags in IUSE, but
    USE_EXPAND variables should be included in IUSE.
    """
    KEYWORDS = ""
    """
    Keywords indicating compatibility.
    Existence of the keyword indicates that the mod is stable on that platform.

    a ~ in front of the keyword indicates that the mod is unstable on that platform
    no keyword indicates that the mod is untested on that platform
    a - in front of the keyword indicates that the mod is known to not work on that platform

    E.g. A package that works on OpenMW but does not on tes3mp::

        KEYWORDS='openmw -tes3mp'

    Keywords can optionally be followed by a :ref:`version-specifier` surrounded by ``{}``.
    This requires setting up version detection so that the ``ARCH_VERSION`` variable
    is available. See :ref:`arch_ver` for details.

    E.g.

    .. code:: python

       KEYWORDS="openmw{>=0.48.0}"

    Lists features which should be disabled for this package

    The following two options are supported:

    * mirror: The package's SRC_URI entries should not be mirrored, and mirrors
      should not be checked when fetching.
    * fetch: The packages's SRC_URI entries should not be fetched automatically,
      and the pkg_nofetch function should be invoked if a source cannot be found.
      This option implies mirror.

    Note that portmod also supports determining these automatically based on source
    URIs and licenses, so it is no longer necessary to set them explicitly. mirror
    is restricted for licenses which are not in the REDISTRIBUTABLE license group
    (see license_groups.yaml), and fetch is restricted for files which are not
    redistributable (according to license) and do not have a scheme in their

    * ``live``: Indicates that the pybuild doesn't have a specific version (e.g. if
        installing from a git repository branch but not using a specific commit).
        Live pybuilds should have an empty KEYWORDS list, as stability testing is
        not meaningful if the upstream source is changing. Live packages must override
        :py:func:`Pybuild2.can_update_live`.
    * ``local``: Only used internally to refer to Local mods with generated metadata
    """
    TEXTURE_SIZES = ""
    """
    A field declaring the texture size options that the package supports.

    If only one texture size option is available, this field need not be included.
    Texture sizes should be numbers representing the size of the texture in pixels.
    Given that textures are usually two-dimensional, the convention is to use:
    :math:`\\sqrt{ l \\cdot w}`

    E.g.::

        TEXTURE_SIZES = "1024 2048"

    This is a special type of USE_EXPAND variable, as use flags are created for its
    values in the form texture_size_SIZE (in the above example texture_size_1024 and
    texture_size_2048).

    These use flags can (and should) be used in the pybuild to enable sources and
    InstallDirs conditionally depending on whether or not the texture size was selected.
    Exactly one of these use flags will be enabled when the mod is installed depending
    on the value of the TEXTURE_SIZE variable in the user's portmod.cfg.

    Not included in the PMS

    SRC_URI = ""
    """
    A List of sources to be fetched.

    If source files should be renamed, this can be done with the arrow operator as
    shown in the example below.

    Sources can be wrapped in use-conditional expressions to prevent certain sources
    from being downloaded unless certain use flags are set or unset.

    E.g.::

        SRC_URI=\"\"\"
            http://mw.modhistory.com/file.php?id=9321 -> FileName-1.0.zip
            flag? ( https://cdn.bethsoft.com/elderscrolls/morrowind/other/masterindex.zip )
        \"\"\"

    Note that if you are renaming files, they should correspond to the original
    filename as best possible, but should also contain version information of some sort
    to prevent conflicts with other sources from the same package. That is, if the
    package is updated, we do not want the updated source name to be the same as a
    previous source name, even if the source name did not change upstream.
