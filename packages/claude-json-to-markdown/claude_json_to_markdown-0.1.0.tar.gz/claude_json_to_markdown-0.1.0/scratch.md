**Updated List of Potential Next Steps & Loose Ends:**

**Minor Polish / Quick Wins:**

1.  **`APP_AUTHOR` in `src/claude_json2md/log_setup.py`**:
    *   **Status**: Still pending.
    *   **Details**: The constant `APP_AUTHOR = "ConverterApp"` is a placeholder. Change `"ConverterApp"` to your actual GitHub username, organization name, or a more specific author string for `platformdirs`.
2.  **Clarity of `logger.info` in `src/claude_json2md/cli.py`**:
    *   **Status**: Still pending.
    *   **Details**: The `main()` function in `cli.py` has a couple of initial log messages. `json_to_markdown` in `converter.py` also logs its entry. Review these to make the initial console/log output more concise and less repetitive. For example, the very first detailed log in `cli.py` might be sufficient, with `json_to_markdown` just logging that its specific part of the process is starting.

**Further Development & Testing:**

4.  **Expand Integration Tests**:
    *   **Status**: Basic integration tests are passing, but coverage can be improved.
    *   **Details**:
        *   Test more edge cases related to file system interactions (e.g., output directory permissions if the script didn't create it, input file not found if not using Typer's `exists=True` or for non-Typer parts).
        *   Test variations of the `--log-path` argument (e.g., direct file path vs. directory path).
        *   Consider testing specific log messages appear for certain error conditions (can be advanced).
5.  **Configuration for Skipping Behavior**:
    *   **Status**: Still pending.
    *   **Details**: Currently, skipping conversations with empty names or no message content is hardcoded. Consider adding CLI flags (e.g., `--no-skip-empty-names`, `--no-skip-empty-content`) to make this behavior configurable.
6.  **Complete Packaging and Distribution Details (if desired for wider use)**:
    *   **Status**: Basic packaging is in place for local install.
    *   **Details**: If you plan to distribute this more widely (e.g., on PyPI):
        *   Complete `pyproject.toml` metadata: `authors`, `description`, `readme`, `license`, `classifiers`, `keywords`.
        *   Update `[project.urls]` from placeholders like `https://github.com/yourusername/claude-json-to-markdown` if you host it publicly.
        *   Learn about building distributions (wheels/sdists) with `uv build` or `hatch build`.

**Lower Priority / Advanced Improvements:**

7.  **More Sophisticated Error Handling in `log_setup.setup_logging`**:
    *   **Status**: Still pending.
    *   **Details**: The fallback if `logging_config.json` is missing is good. If `logging.config.dictConfig(config)` itself fails after the config file *is* loaded, the error handling could be more robust or provide more specific user feedback.
8.  **Input Validation with Pydantic**:
    *   **Status**: Still pending.
    *   **Details**: For very robust validation of the input JSON structure against an expected schema, Pydantic models could be introduced. This is likely overkill for the current scope but a good pattern for complex data.
9.  **Error Handling in `create_slug` (very minor edge case)**:
    *   **Status**: Low priority.
    *   **Details**: The observation about a slug potentially becoming empty *after* the initial `if not text:` check but *before* the final `if not slug:` is technically still valid but the current logic with `strip('-')` after truncation likely makes this extremely rare and sufficiently handled.

---

Given this, I'd recommend tackling items in this order of priority:
1.  **Documentation / README.md** (High - makes the project usable).
2.  **`APP_AUTHOR`** (Minor Polish - quick fix).
3.  **Clarity of `logger.info` in `cli.py`** (Minor Polish - improves UX).
Then move on to "Further Development & Testing" as desired.
