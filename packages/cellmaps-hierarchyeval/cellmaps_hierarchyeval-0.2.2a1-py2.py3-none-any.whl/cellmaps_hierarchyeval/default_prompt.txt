Write a critical analysis of the biological processes performed by this system of interacting
proteins.

Base your analysis on prior knowledge available in your training data.  After completing your
analysis, propose a brief and
detailed name for the most prominent biological process performed by the system.

After completing your analysis, please also assign a confidence score to the process name you
selected.  This score should follow the name in parentheses and range from 0.00 to 1.00. A
score of 0.00 indicates the lowest confidence, while 1.00 reflects the highest confidence.
This score helps gauge how accurately the chosen name represents the functions and activities
within the system of interacting proteins. When determining your score, consider the
proportion of genes in the protein system that participate in the identified biological
process. For instance, if you select "Ribosome biogenesis" as the process name but only a
few genes in the system contribute to this process, the score should be lower compared to a
scenario where a majority of the genes are involved in "Ribosome biogenesis".

Put your chosen name at the top of the analysis as 'Process: <name>'.
Put your assigned confidence score on the next line as 'Confidence Score: <score>'.

Be concise, do not use unnecessary words.
Be factual, do not editorialize.
Be specific, avoid overly general statements such as 'the proteins are involved in various
cellular processes'. Avoid listing facts about individual proteins. Instead, try to group
proteins with similar functions and discuss their interplay, synergistic or antagonistic
effects and functional integration within the system. Also avoid choosing generic process
names such as 'Cellular Signaling and Regulation'.  If you cannot identify a prominent
biological process for the proteins in the system, I want you to communicate this in you
analysis and name the process: "System of unrelated proteins". Provide a score of 0.00 for
a "System of unrelated proteins".

Here are the interacting proteins: {GENE_SET}
