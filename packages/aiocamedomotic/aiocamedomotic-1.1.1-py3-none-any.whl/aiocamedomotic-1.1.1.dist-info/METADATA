The **CAME Domotic Unofficial Library** (`aiocamedomotic <https://github.com/camedomotic-unofficial/aiocamedomotic>`_)
provides a streamlined Python interface for interacting with CAME Domotic plants, much
like the official
`CAME Domotic app <https://www.came.com/global/itex/installers/solutions/domotica-e-termoregolazione/prodotti-compatibili-domotica/app-domotic-30>`_.
This library is designed to simplify the management of domotic devices by abstracting
the complexities of the CAME Domotic API.

Although primarily developed for use with
`Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io/>`_, the library is freely available
under the `Apache license 2.0 <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ for anyone
interested in experimenting with a CAME Domotic plant.


.. important::
    This library is independently developed and is not affiliated with, endorsed by,
    or supported by `CAME <https://www.came.com/>`_. It may not be compatible with all
    CAME Domotic systems. While this library is stable and publicly released, it comes√π
    with no guarantees. Use at your own risk.

.. danger::

    This library is not intended for use in critical systems, such as security or
    life-support systems. Always use official and supported tools for such applications.


Key Features
------------
- **Simplicity**: Easy interaction with domotic entities.
- **Automatic session management**: No need for manual login or session handling.
- **First of its kind**: Unique in providing integration with CAME Domotic systems.
- **Open source**: Freely available under the Apache 2.0 license, inviting
  contributions and adaptations.
