# Kisesi
Kisesi is a light wrapper around the built-in `logging` module of Python
standard library. This module is written in a hacky way and thus is meant for
personal use.

# Demos
```python
import kisesi


def main() -> None:
    kisesi.basic_config(level=kisesi.DEBUG, incdate=True)

    log = kisesi.get_logger(__name__)
    log.debug("This is a \"debug\" message.")
    log.info("This is a \"info\" message.")
    log.warning("This is a \"warning\" message.")
    log.error("This is a \"error\" message.")
    log.critical("This is a \"critical\" message.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
