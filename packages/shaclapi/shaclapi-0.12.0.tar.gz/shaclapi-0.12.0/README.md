# shaclAPI

The shaclAPI is a project meant to integrate the **SHACL** validation  into the **SPARQL** query execution. Given a knowledge graph a **SPARQL** query gives a set of solution mappings. The **SHACL** validation of a SHACL shape schema over the knowledge graph gives validation results per pair of shape in the network and target entitiy assigned to the shape. The shaclAPI annotates the entities in the solution mappings with the validation result assigned by the SHACL validation. Further SHACL engine - agnostic heuristics are implemented, to reduce the overhead of the validation.

## Setup
### Webservice
#### Docker
In order to run the shaclAPI, build the Docker image from the source code:

```bash
docker build . -t sdmtib/shaclAPI:latest
```

Once the Docker image is built, you can start the shaclAPI:

```bash
docker run --name api -d -p 9999:5000 sdmtib/shaclAPI:latest
```

The shaclAPI will be reachable at http://localhost:9999. For the following examples execute:

```bash
API=localhost:9999
```

#### Docker Compose
A docker-compose file is provided, therefore the shaclAPI can be run using:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The shaclAPI will be accessible at http://localhost:9999. For the following examples execute:

```bash
API=localhost:9999
```

#### Python
To run the shaclAPI directly using python 3.8.11 with the flask development server, the python dependencies need to be installed:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Depending on the operating system `start.bat` or `start.sh` can now be used to start the shaclAPI.
The shaclAPI will be accessible at http://localhost:5000. For the following examples execute:

```bash
API=localhost:5000
```

### Library
To use the shaclAPI as a library it is recommended to use python 3.8.11, however other versions might work as well.
Install the python dependencies using:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Webservice
You can use the shaclAPI by making HTTP requests. The following describes the different API calls:

#### GET: /
Returns `Hello World` and should be used to check whether the API is running or not.

Example call:
```bash
curl -X GET $API/
```
#### POST: /multiprocessing
This is the main API call, used to send a query to the SPARQL endpoint and simultaneously execute the SHACL validation to validate the query results.
There are various options, which can be provided as parameters of the HTTP POST request. Additionally, a configuration file formatted as JSON can be provided with the config option. HTTP POST parameters will override the options configured in the configuration file.

Example configuration:
```json
{
    "external_endpoint": "http://dbpedia.org/sparql",
    "query": "PREFIX dbo:<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbr:<http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nPREFIX dbp:<http://dbpedia.org/property/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n    ?x a dbo:Film. \n ?x dbp:studio dbr:Walt_Disney_Pictures\n}",
    "schemaDir": "./examples/dbpedia/shapes/",
    "targetShape": "MovieShape",
    "backend": "travshacl",
    "output_format": "simple"
}
```

Example call:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "config=./examples/dbpedia/config.json" $API/multiprocessing
```

Example output:
```json
[
	[
		{"?x": "dbr:Tex_(film)"},  # The query result given in the form of the original SPARQL bindings
		[ # Triples to explain the SPARQL bindings
			["dbr:Tex_(film)", "dbp:studio", "dbr:Walt_Disney_Pictures"], 
			["dbr:Tex_(film)", "a", "dbo:Film"], 
			["dbr:Tex_(film)", "dbo:imdbId", "<0084783>"], 
			["dbr:Tex_(film)", "dbo:starring", "dbr:Matt_Dillon"]
		], 
		[ # The validation result assigned to the SPARQL bindings. Each entity occuring in the SPARQL bindings can violate (ts:violatesShape) or satisfy (ts:satisfiesShape) a given instance:
			["dbr:Tex_(film)", "ts:violatesShape", "MovieShape"]
		]
	], 
	[
		{"?x": "dbr:Night_Crossing"}, 
		[
			["dbr:Night_Crossing", "dbp:studio", "dbr:Walt_Disney_Pictures"], 
			["dbr:Night_Crossing", "a", "dbo:Film"], 
			["dbr:Night_Crossing", "dbo:imdbId", "<0082810>"], 
			["dbr:Night_Crossing", "dbo:starring", "dbr:Doug_McKeon"]
		], 
		[
			["dbr:Night_Crossing", "ts:violatesShape", "MovieShape"]
		]
	], ...
]
```
There are further examples provided in the `examples` directory.

#### POST: /validation
This API call can be used to execute the SHACL validation  over the given SPARQL endpoint, while reducing the workload using the given heuristics and give the number of valid/invalid instances per Shape. There are various options, which can be provided as parameters of the HTTP POST request. Additionally, a configuration file formatted as JSON can be provided with the config option. HTTP POST parameters will override the options configured in the configuration file. 

Using the same configuration as with `/multiprocessing`:

Example call:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "config=./examples/dbpedia/config.json" $API/validation
```

Example output:
```json
{"MovieShape":{"invalid":50,"valid":0}}
```


#### POST: /reduce
This API call can be used to retrieve the shape names of the reduced shape schema given a starting shape.
The options for this call can be provided as parameters of the HTTP POST request or as a JSON file using the config option.
HTTP POST parameters will override the options configured in the configuration file.

Example call:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "schemaDir=./examples/lubm/shapes/" -d "targetShape=Department" $API/reduce
```

Example output:
```json
{"shapes":["Department","University"]}
```
