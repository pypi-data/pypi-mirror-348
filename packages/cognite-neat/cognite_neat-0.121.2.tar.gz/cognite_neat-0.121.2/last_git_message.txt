[NEAT-922] ðŸ‘· Fix missing unquote (#1164) (#1165)

# Description

Fix missing unquote. In addition, found another bug causing an
unnecessary warning. Not this was not exposed to the user thus it is not

## Changelog
### Fixed

- When reading assets, events, sequences, etc. using
`neat.read.cdf.classic...`. The conversion of label to tags no longer
changes non-alpha numeric characters. For example, if you had a label
`å·¥äº‹` it would previous be changed by neat to `%E5%B7%A5%E4%BA%8B'. This
is now fixed.
