#### Instructions

<a name="prerelease"></a>
<details><summary>Creating a pre-release</summary><br>

GitHub is not able to create annotated releases (https://github.com/seqan/product_backlog/issues/159), so we have to manually sign the release.
Make sure you have set up [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
```bash
git checkout release-[VERSION]
git tag -s [VERSION]-rc.[RC] # e.g. 3.1.0-rc.1
git push upstream [VERSION]-rc.[RC]
```

You will need to provide a tag message. Since this is a pre-release, it can be as simple as `Tag 3.1.0-rc.1`.

Now follow the [packaging instructions](#packaging) to create `seqan3-[VERSION]-rc.[RC]-{Linux,Source}.tar.xz{,.sha265}`.

Go to https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/releases and create a new release using the created tag and attach the source packages.

:warning: **Make sure to set the tick for "This is a pre-release"** :warning:

Once again, the release message can be simply something along the lines of:
```
This is the first release candidate for SeqAn 3.0.3

You can find a list of changes in our [changelog](https://docs.seqan.de/seqan/3.0.3/about_changelog.html).
```

Afterwards, bump the succeeding release candidate number in the release branch: [include/seqan3/version.hpp](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/blob/3.0.2/include/seqan3/version.hpp#L19-L24).

</details>
<a name="cppreference"></a>
<details><summary>Updating cppreference index</summary><br>

Check for [new releases](https://github.com/PeterFeicht/cppreference-doc/releases) and update the link and hash in [test/documentation/seqan3-doxygen.cmake](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/blob/b0b279689fa65c2431a5162f2d8acc3ca663f72d/test/documentation/seqan3-doxygen.cmake#L37).
You can compute the hash via `wget -O- <link to html book> | sha256sum`.

</details>
<a name="freeze"></a>
<details><summary>Freezing the release branch</summary><br>

- Make sure all PRs that should be merged are merged.
- Set `SEQAN3_RELEASE_CANDIDATE` to `0` [include/seqan3/version.hpp](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/blob/3.0.2/include/seqan3/version.hpp#L19-L24).
- This should be the last commit before the release.

</details>
<a name="versioned-docs"></a>
<details><summary>Creating versioned documentation</summary><br>

1. Checkout the release tag and build documentation.
2. Create a #.#.# directory for the release in `/web/docs.seqan.de/htdocs/seqan/`
3. Copy everything from the build (`doc_usr/html/*`) into the directory.
4. Alter the file `/web/docs.seqan.de/htdocs/seqan3.html` with a link to the new documentation build.

</details>
<a name="packaging"></a>
<details><summary>Creating source packages</summary><br>

Use a new clone of the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seqan/seqan3.git
cd seqan3
git checkout release-[VERSION] # version/branch to pack
git submodule update --init

mkdir ../package-build
cd ../package-build

cmake ../seqan3 # configure
cpack # builds binary package, e.g. seqan3-[VERSION]-Linux.tar.xz{,.sha265}
cmake --build . --target package_source # builds source package, e.g. seqan3-[VERSION]-Source.tar.xz{,.sha265}
```

Note: Do not use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/seqan/seqan3.git` because it will recursively pull sub-submodules!

</details>
<a name="changelog"></a>
<details><summary>Checking the changelog</summary><br>

- List all supported compiler, also add to https://docs.seqan.de/seqan3/main_user/about_api.html#autotoc_md35.
- Check that all links are consistent, e.g., `[\#2540](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/2538)`:
  - Search `(\[\\#)(\d+)(\]\(.+?)(\d+)(\))` and replace `$1$2$3$2$5` (i.e., replace link issue-id by the displayed id).

</details>
<a name="release"></a>
<details><summary>Creating a release</summary><br>

GitHub is not able to create annotated releases (https://github.com/seqan/product_backlog/issues/159), so we have to manually sign the release.
Make sure you have set up [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
```bash
git checkout release-[VERSION]
git tag -s [VERSION]
git push upstream [VERSION]
```

You will need to provide a tag message. We use the first sentences of the release note:

E.g. (see https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/tags)
```
SeqAn 3.0.2 Release


Despite all circumstances, we are excited to present a new update of our SeqAn library.
We present some great new features and also a lot of usability improvements.
Among others, this release will fully comply with the final C++-20 standard.

:warning: In this release we harmonised the algorithm configurations for a better user experience.
This, much like 2020, will break a lot of code. But rest assured that the changes are easy to apply and are worth every bit. :smile:

You can find a comprehensive list of the changes in our [changelog](https://docs.seqan.de/seqan/3.0.2/about_changelog.html).
```

</details>
<a name="version-bump"></a>
<details><summary>Bumping the version</summary><br>

- Bump succeeding version number in the main branch: [include/seqan3/version.hpp](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/blob/3.0.2/include/seqan3/version.hpp#L19-L24).
- The `SEQAN3_RELEASE_CANDIDATE` must be set to `1` as `0` indicates a stable release.
- Bump the latest stable version number of the API-Stability test in main: [test/api_stability/CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/blob/3.0.3/test/api_stability/CMakeLists.txt#L10).
