# django-dynamic-formset

This package is part of an academic research project on software supply chain security,  
conducted at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University.

## Purpose

This package intentionally uses a name similar to a standard Python module  
to study how often such packages are unintentionally downloaded from PyPI by users or automated tools.

## Research Details

- Project Title: Behavioral Analysis of Name Confusion in Open-Source Package Repositories  
- Institution: School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University  
- Supervisor: Prof. Kaifeng Huang  
- Researcher: Guangye Bai  
- Contact: 2253637@tongji.edu.cn

## Package Behavior

This package contains no malicious code.
