# python-a2a version needs to be determined based on the actual package
# For now, let's assume it's available and specify a placeholder or a known version.
# If python_a2a is a local package/submodule within this project, 
# it would be handled differently in the Dockerfile (e.g., COPY and install).
# Assuming it's pip-installable for now.

# This line assumes alo_agent_sdk is installable as a package.
# If building from source within a larger context, this might be handled by copying source
# or installing from a local path. For a generated project, direct dependency is clearer.
# Replace with actual path or version as needed, e.g.
# alo-agent-sdk @ git+https://github.com/yourusername/alo_agent_sdk.git@main
# alo-agent-sdk # If on PyPI
# ./path/to/local/alo_agent_sdk # If installing from a local directory/wheel that contains pyproject.toml for alo-agent-sdk
# Example for local development (if this template is generated outside the SDK repo, adjust path):
# ../../alo_agent_sdk # Assuming the generated project is a sibling to the SDK repo's root
# Or, path to a built .whl file:
# ./path/to/alo_agent_sdk-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl 
alo-agent-sdk # This line should work if alo-agent-sdk is installed (e.g. from PyPI or editable install of the SDK)
