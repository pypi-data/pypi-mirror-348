## Integration with Compiler

The Metal backend compiler pipeline automatically detects M3 hardware and applies appropriate optimizations:

1. The hardware detection module (`metal_hardware_optimizer.py`) identifies the chip generation
2. When M3 is detected, specialized optimization modules are activated
3. The compiler applies M3-specific optimizations during MLX conversion and memory layout assignment
4. Performance statistics and optimization records are added to the metadata

## Key Implementation Techniques

### 1. Tensor Core Utilization

For matrix operations on M3, we:
- Use tile sizes that align with tensor core dimensions (multiple of 16)
- Set execution parameters to enable tensor core operations
- Apply specialized memory layouts for optimal tensor core performance

### 2. Enhanced Memory Layouts

M3-specific memory layouts include:
- 32x32 blocks for matrix operations (vs 16x16 on M1/M2)
- Specialized layouts for convolution filters aligned with wider SIMD groups
- Hierarchical memory layouts for efficient reduction operations

### 3. Vectorization Strategies

M3's 8-wide vector capabilities are leveraged by:
- Vectorizing memory access operations
- Applying vector-friendly memory layouts
- Unrolling loops for better utilization of vector units
