# TODO: Future Improvements for COALESCED Memory Layout

This document outlines planned future improvements and enhancements for the COALESCED memory layout optimization for reduction operations in the Metal backend.

## High Priority

1. **Performance optimization for large reductions**
   - Implement adaptive threshold for two-stage reduction based on hardware capabilities
   - Optimize memory access patterns for very large reductions (>10M elements)
   - Benchmark and tune the two-stage reduction algorithm for different Apple Silicon generations

2. **Auto-tuning support**
   - Add auto-tuning parameters specific to COALESCED layout
   - Integrate with the Metal auto-tuner to find optimal parameters for different reduction sizes
   - Create tuning profiles for different reduction operations (sum, mean, max, etc.)

3. **Better integration with other optimizations**
   - Coordinate with fusion optimizer to preserve COALESCED layout benefits during operation fusion
   - Ensure proper interaction with other memory layouts when operations are composed

## Medium Priority

1. **Enhanced hardware-specific optimizations**
   - M1-specific optimizations for COALESCED layout
   - M2-specific optimizations leveraging improved memory bandwidth
   - M3-specific optimizations using dynamic caching capabilities
   - Ensure future-proofing for upcoming Apple Silicon generations

2. **Support for complex reduction patterns**
   - Optimize multi-dimensional tensor reductions with irregular patterns
   - Support for masked reductions
   - Handle dynamic shapes more efficiently

3. **Additional benchmarking and profiling**
   - Create comprehensive benchmark suite for different reduction patterns
   - Add detailed profiling capabilities for COALESCED layout operations
   - Generate performance reports comparing COALESCED vs other layouts

## Low Priority

1. **More documentation and examples**
   - Add visual diagrams explaining COALESCED memory layout
   - Create more example kernels demonstrating best practices
   - Add tutorial on writing reduction kernels that leverage COALESCED layout

2. **Additional tools**
   - Visual analysis tool for memory layout visualization
   - Layout-aware kernel generator for optimal reduction operations
   - Integration with Metal Debugger for real-time analysis

3. **Enhancements to existing tools**
   - Add more detailed analysis in the `simple_analyzer.py` tool
   - Support batch processing in analysis tools
   - Add performance prediction capabilities

## Implementation Notes

### Two-Stage Reduction Improvements

The current two-stage reduction implementation works well for moderately large reductions, but could be improved:

```python
# Current threshold
threshold = 1024  # Use two-stage reduction if dimension size > 1024

# Proposed adaptive approach
def determine_threshold(hardware_gen, available_memory, dtype):
    if hardware_gen == "M3":
        base_threshold = 2048
    elif hardware_gen == "M2":
        base_threshold = 1536
    else:  # M1 or unknown
        base_threshold = 1024
    
    # Adjust based on datatype (e.g., float16 can use larger threshold)
    # and available memory
    return adjust_threshold(base_threshold, dtype, available_memory)
```

### SIMD Optimization Notes

To fully leverage SIMD capabilities, we need to align data access and use appropriate vectorization:

```python
# Current vectorization is fixed
vector_width = 4  # Default vector width

# Proposed approach
def determine_vector_width(hardware_gen, dtype):
    if hardware_gen == "M3":
        if dtype in ["float16", "bfloat16"]:
            return 8
        else:
            return 4
    else:
        if dtype in ["float16", "bfloat16"]:
            return 4
        else:
            return 2
```

## Testing Requirements

For future improvements, we should add:

1. Performance regression tests that verify COALESCED layout maintains its performance advantage
2. Compatibility tests with other optimizations
3. Hardware-specific tests that only run on specific Apple Silicon generations

## Tracking

Progress on these items will be tracked in the GitHub issue tracker with the label `memory-layout-coalesced`.
