## Getting Started

The Triton Metal backend is designed to enable Triton kernels to run on Apple Silicon GPUs via the Metal API. Before contributing, we recommend:

1. Familiarizing yourself with the [Triton programming model](https://chenxingqiang.github.io/triton-metalmain/programming-guide/index.html)
2. Understanding the [Metal backend architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. Reviewing our [optimization guides](PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md) and [M3-specific optimizations](M3_OPTIMIZATIONS.md)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS 13.5 or higher
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3)
- Xcode 15.0 or higher
- Python 3.8 or higher
- MLX 0.3.0 or higher

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Clone the Triton repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chenxingqiang/triton-metal.git
   cd triton
   ```

2. Install the development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[tests,metal]"
   ```

3. Build Triton with Metal support:
   ```bash
   cd python
   TRITON_BUILD_WITH_METAL=1 pip install -e .
   ```

4. Run the Metal backend tests to ensure your environment is set up correctly:
   ```bash
   cd test/unit
   python -m pytest -xvs metal/
   ```

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Finding Issues to Work On

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/chenxingqiang/triton-metal/issues) tab for issues labeled with `backend:metal`, `good first issue`, or `help wanted`
- Feel free to ask for clarification on any issue before starting work

### 2. Creating a New Issue

If you've found a bug or have a feature request:

1. Check if a similar issue already exists
2. If not, create a new issue using the appropriate template:
   - For bugs, include: OS version, Metal backend version, device information, and steps to reproduce
   - For features, include: clear description, use case, and potential implementation approach

### 3. Working on an Issue

1. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
2. Create a new branch from the latest `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/metal-your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes, following the [coding standards](#coding-standards)
4. Add tests for your changes
5. Update documentation as needed

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before Creating a PR**:
   - Ensure all tests pass: `python -m pytest -xvs test/unit/metal/`
   - Run the style checks: `pre-commit run --all-files`
   - Update any relevant documentation

2. **Creating the PR**:
   - Submit your PR against the `main` branch
   - Use the PR template to provide a clear description of your changes
   - Link the PR to any relevant issues using GitHub keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123")

3. **PR Review Process**:
   - A maintainer will review your PR
   - Address any requested changes or feedback
   - Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

4. **After Your PR is Merged**:
   - Delete your branch
   - Celebrate your contribution! ðŸŽ‰

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guidelines

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Document functions and classes using docstrings

### C++ Style Guidelines

- Follow the [LLVM Coding Standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)
- Use consistent formatting with clang-format (use `.clang-format` in the repository)
- Document public APIs with doxygen-style comments

### Metal-Specific Guidelines

- Use Metal best practices for performance
- Document any hardware-specific optimizations
- Include fallbacks for different Apple Silicon generations
- Prefer MLX abstractions over direct Metal API calls when possible

## Testing Guidelines

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

- **Unit tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Performance tests**: For performance-critical code, include benchmarks
- **Metal-specific tests**: Test across different Apple Silicon generations if possible

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all Metal backend tests
python -m pytest -xvs test/unit/metal/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest -xvs test/unit/metal/test_specific_feature.py

# Run a specific test
python -m pytest -xvs test/unit/metal/test_file.py::test_function_name
```

## Documentation Guidelines

Good documentation is crucial for the usability of the Metal backend:

- Update user-facing documentation when changing APIs
- Document M3-specific optimizations separately from general Metal backend features
- Add comments for complex algorithms or hardware-specific optimizations
- Include examples for new features

## Community

- Join the [Triton community](https://discord.gg/ZRH2Kk2ju3) on Discord
- Participate in discussions in the `#metal-backend` channel
- Help answer questions from other users
- Share your use cases and success stories
