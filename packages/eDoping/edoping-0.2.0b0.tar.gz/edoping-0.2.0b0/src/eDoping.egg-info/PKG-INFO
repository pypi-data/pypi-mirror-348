## Installiation

The `eDoping` package is built on Python3, so please ensure that it is 
properly installed on your system. You can download the source code 
from GitHub using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/JianboHIT/eDoping.git
```

For users in mainland China, the source code is also available on Gitee. 
You can clone it using a similar command:

```
git clone https://gitee.com/joulehit/eDoping.git
```

After downloading the source code, navigate to the folder (make sure to 
unzip it if you downloaded it as a zip file) and ensure your internet 
connection is stable. Then, you can use `pip` (or `pip3`) to automatically 
install the package along with its dependencies, which primarily include 
NumPy and SciPy:

```
pip install .
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the `eDoping` package 
with the edp command. To verify that the installation was successful, 
you can use the `-h` (or `--help`) option to display the help information:

```
edp -h
```

This will print out the help information for the `eDoping` package, including 
all available sub-commands.
