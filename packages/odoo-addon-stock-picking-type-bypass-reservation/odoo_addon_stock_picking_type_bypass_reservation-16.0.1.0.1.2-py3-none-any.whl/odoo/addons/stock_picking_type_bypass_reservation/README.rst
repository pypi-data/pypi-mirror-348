This module extends the functionality of Operations Types to support
bypass reservations and to allow you to create Stock Move Lines fully
reserved even if you don't have stock.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because in certain flows, you need to ship
goods before you have registered your stock in Odoo.

It will be useful for you if you want to prepare Pickings or Waves
before you have the product in stock (and you have partial availability
or nothing) or you ship the product before you add stock on the system.

If you need this module for those reasons, these might interest you too:

- stock_picking_auto_create_lot

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Create a new storable product without stock
2. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operations Types and select an
   Internal or Outgoing one
3. Enable debug mode
4. Enable Bypass Reservation
5. Create a picking with the operation types where Bypass Reservation
   was enabled
6. Confirm the picking and check quantities are reserved even without
   stock

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Pickings of Operations Types with Bypass Reservations will be reserved
  on picking/move Confirmation even if the Operation Type Reservation
  Method is not "At Confirmation".
