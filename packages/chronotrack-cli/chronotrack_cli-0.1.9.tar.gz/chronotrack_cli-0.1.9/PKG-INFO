## üì¨ Email Reports with Custom Domain (Resend Setup)

ChronoTrack allows you to **automatically send weekly productivity reports** via email using [Resend](https://resend.com). To do this properly and avoid spam issues, you'll need to verify your own domain.

![Report Example](images/htmlreport.png)


---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Set Up Your Domain on Resend

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up
2. Click on **"Domains"** ‚Üí **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
4. Add the DNS records (SPF, DKIM, Return-Path) to your domain‚Äôs registrar
5. Wait for the domain to be **verified** by Resend

---

### üîë Step 2: Generate API Key

1. Go to Resend ‚Üí **"API Keys"**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Copy and save this key securely

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
SENDER_EMAIL=yourname@yourdomain.com
```

> Your `SENDER_EMAIL` must match the verified domain.

---

### üì§ Step 4: Send a Report via CLI

You can generate and send your weekly report with:

```bash
chronotrack report --email yourname@yourdomain.com 
```

Or You Can Preview in Web

```bash
chronotrack report --preview 
```

This will:
- Build a complete HTML report of the past week
- Open it in your browser
- Send it to the specified email

---

### üîÅ Step 5: Enable Automated Weekly Reports

Run the guided setup:

```bash
chronotrack set_schedule
```

You‚Äôll be asked:

```
üì¨ Enter the email to receive reports:
‚è≥ How often should reports be sent (in days)?
```

This creates a `user_preferences.json` file, and you can then schedule the following script to run daily:

```bash
python chronotrack_scheduled_runner.py
```

Use `crontab -e` or macOS `launchd` to schedule it.

---

> üí° **Note**: You must keep the `.env` file available for environment access during scheduled execution.





## üíæ Data Management

### Data Storage

ChronoTrack stores your session data in a simple, human-readable JSON file:

```
~/.chronotrack/session_log.json
```

### Data Format

Each session is stored in the following structure:

```json
{
  "task": "Write blog post",
  "tag": "writing",
  "start": "2025-05-13T12:30:00",
  "end": "2025-05-13T13:45:00",
  "duration_minutes": 65.0,
  "breaks": [
    {"start": "2025-05-13T13:00:00", "end": "2025-05-13T13:05:00", "duration_minutes": 5.0}
  ],
  "total_breaks": 1,
  "total_break_time": 5.0,
  "note": "Felt very focused",
  "note_added": true
}
```

### Exporting Data

Export your data for external analysis:

```bash
# Export to JSON
chronotrack export json

# Export to CSV
chronotrack export csv

# Specify custom output location
chronotrack export json --output ~/Documents/productivity_data.json
```

### Backup Recommendations

- Create periodic backups of your `session_log.json` file
- Consider version control for your productivity data
- Use the export functionality before major updates

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: The session data file can become corrupt if ChronoTrack is terminated improperly (e.g., during a system crash). Always ensure proper program termination and maintain regular backups.**
>
> **üí° BEST PRACTICE: Set up automatic backups of your `~/.chronotrack` directory using a scheduler or backup tool of your choice.**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Configuration File

Customize ChronoTrack behavior by creating a `~/.chronotrack/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Default tag when none is specified
default_tag: "general"

# Custom color scheme
colors:
  active: "green"
  paused: "yellow"
  stopped: "red"
  
# Auto-pause after inactivity (minutes)
auto_pause: 15

# Default report format
default_report: "detailed"
```

### Environment Variables

Configure behavior with environment variables:

```bash
# Set data directory
export CHRONOTRACK_DATA_DIR="/path/to/data"

# Enable debug mode
export CHRONOTRACK_DEBUG=1
```

> **üí° BEST PRACTICE: When setting a custom data directory with `CHRONOTRACK_DATA_DIR`, choose a location that's backed up by your existing backup system.**

---

## üß† Philosophy

ChronoTrack is built on several core principles:

1. **Terminal-First** - For developers who live in the command line
2. **Minimal Friction** - Track time without disrupting your workflow
3. **Data Ownership** - Your productivity data stays on your machine
4. **Insightful Analytics** - Measure to improve your work patterns
5. **Extensibility** - Simple data format for easy integration

- **Consultants & freelancers** who need accurate time logs
- **Students** managing study sessions and breaks
- Anyone seeking **actionable productivity insights**

> **üí° BEST PRACTICE: Incorporate ChronoTrack into your workflow gradual‚Äîstart by tracking just one type of task before expanding to your full workday.**

```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Do not manually edit the `session_log.json` file while ChronoTrack is running as this could cause data inconsistencies.**

### Best Practices

- Always **stop** a session before starting a new one
- Use **consistent tag names** for better reporting
- Add **detailed notes** for context when stopping a session
- Run **weekly reports** to identify productivity patterns
- Export data **regularly** for safekeeping

> **üí° BEST PRACTICE: Create aliases for your most commonly used ChronoTrack commands in your shell configuration file:**
>
> ```bash
> # Add to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or equivalent
> alias cts="chronotrack start"
> alias ctp="chronotrack pause"
> alias ctr="chronotrack play"  # resume
> alias cte="chronotrack stop"  # end
> alias ctl="chronotrack log today"
> alias ctl="chronotrack report --preview"
> alias ctl="chronotrack report --email <yourmail>"
> ```
