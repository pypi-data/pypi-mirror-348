 ### What are tools?
 
-Large Language Models (LLMs) are like a highly intelligent person who can understand and reason about almost anything but is sitting in an empty room with no ability to interact with the outside world. They can think and talk about sending emails, creating a ticket on Jira, or cloning a repository from github, but can't actually DO these things.

 This is where tools come in. Tools give this intelligent being specific abilities to interact with the real world. Many AI models support tool calling (also called function calling).

 ### Tool calling with Composio
 
-At Composio, we offer tools for multiple platforms, accessible via Python and JavaScript SDKs. These platforms, referred to as **Apps** or **Tools**, include popular services like GitHub, Twitter, Salesforce, Jira, and Notion. Within each of these Apps, we provide **Actions**, which are essentially functions that can be executed. For example, you can send an email on Gmail, star a repository on GitHub, or create an issue on Jira. These tools can also be used directly, similar to function calls, without needing agents.

+Use the `ComposioToolSet` class to use and configure tools:
+- Use [composio-core](https://pypi.org/project/composio-core) package for non-agentic use cases
+- Use framework-specific packages [composio-langchain](https://pypi.org/project/composio-langchain) or [composio-crewai](https://pypi.org/project/composio-crewai) when working with Agentic frameworks
 
-<CodeGroup>
+See all supported frameworks [here](../../framework/autogen).
+
+### Arguments Accepted by ComposioToolSet
+
+#### Basic Uscase:
+- `api_key`: Composio API key. Get your API key [here](https://app.composio.dev/developers)
+- `entity_id`: The ID of the entity to execute the action on. Defaults to **default**
+- `connected_account_ids`: Use this to define connected accounts to use when executing an action for a specific app
+
+#### Extensive Use Case:
+- `output_dir`: Directory path to store downloaded files
+- `metadata`: Additional metadata for executing an action. Learn more [here](use-tools/configure-tools)
+- `processors`: Request and response processors, use these to pre-process requests before executing an action and post-process the response after an action has been executed. Learn more [here](use-tools/processing-actions)
+- `logging_level`: Accepted values: CRITICAL, FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
+- `verbosity_level`: This defines the size of the log object that will be printed on the console
+
+#### Advanced Use Case:
+- `base_url`: Base URL for the Composio API server
+- `output_in_file`: Whether to output the result to a file
+- `workspace_id`: Workspace ID for loading an existing workspace
+- `workspace_config`: Used to specify the configuration for the workspace environment. Supported workspace types: Host, Docker, FlyIO, and E2B
+- `max_retries`: Maximum number of times a tool should be retried in case of a failure during execution
+- `**kwargs`: Additional arguments for advanced use cases
