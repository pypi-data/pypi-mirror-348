## Getting Started

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
<Steps>
<Step title="Installation">
```bash install the required dependencies
pip install composio-core
```
</Step>

<Step title="Connecting to tools and models">
```bash connect to required tools
composio add gmail
composio add hubspot

export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"
```
</Step>

<Step title="Importing the required libraries">
```python import required libraries
from composio_llamaindex import ComposioToolSet, App, Action
from llama_index.core.agent import FunctionCallingAgentWorker
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```
</Step>

<Step title="Initializing the Tools and the LLM">
```python initialize toolset and llm
toolset = ComposioToolSet(api_key="")
tools = toolset.get_tools(apps=[App.HUBSPOT, App.GMAIL])

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
```
</Step>

<Step title="Setting up Function Calling Worker">
```python setup function calling worker
prefix_messages = [
    ChatMessage(
        role="system",
        content=(
            f"""
            "You are a Lead Outreach Agent that is has access to the CRM through HubSpot."
            "and is an expert writer. Your job is to first research some info about the lead "
            "given to you and then draft a perfect ideal email for whatever input task is given to you. "
            """
        ),
    )

    prefix_messages=prefix_messages,
    max_function_calls=10,
    allow_parallel_tool_calls=False,
    verbose=True,
).as_agent()
```
</Step>

<Step title="Executing the Agent">
```python execute the agent
user_input = f"Draft an email for each lead in my Hubspot contacts page introducing yourself and asking them if they're interested in integrating AI Agents in their workflow."
response = agent.chat(user_input)
```
