 description: "The project generates and executes code based on user-defined problems. It utilizes the Composio and connects your AI Agent to E2B's Code Interpreter to facilitate code execution, allowing users to input a problem statement and receive executable code as output. The agent is designed to operate in a sandbox environment, ensuring safe execution and accurate results. Key functionalities include code generation, execution, and result interpretation, making it an invaluable resource for developers and data scientists alike."
