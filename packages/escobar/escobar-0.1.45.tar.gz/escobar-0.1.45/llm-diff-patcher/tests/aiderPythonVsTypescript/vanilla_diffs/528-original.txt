### What is an Integration? (Controlling the OAuth Experience)

In Composio, Integration Object refer to configurations used when creating a new connection for a user.

<Note> (eg. Permissions to ask for when connecting an account, ClientID/Secret of custom developer app for OAuth) </Note>

For example 
- Create an integration for GitHub with OAuth authentication and "Repo Read" permission.
- Use this integration when users connect their GitHub accounts to ensure consistent, limited access.

### Creating an Integration

<Note> Recommended method to create an integration is via UI. (Only limited integrations are required) </Note>

<Info> One integration can be used by multiple users to connect their accounts. </Info>

![Creating an Integration with Dashboard](/patterns/auth/gifs/integration.gif)

1. Login at [Composio's Website](https://app.composio.dev)
2. Go to the Tools section
3. Click on any app you want to integrate
4. Click on Setup on [App Name] Integration
5. Choose your integration name and click Save
6. Then Click on "Connect to [App Name]" and Authenticate with your Account
7. Congratulations! Integration was successful!

### Creating a new connection using an Integration

You can follow the same steps as mentioned in [Creating a new connection](/patterns/auth/connected_account) and instead of passing app you can pass integration_id.

### Whitelabeling the OAuth Developer App Using Integrations 

Integrations can be used to customise the OAuth Developer App that is shown to the user when initiating a connection.

Create an Integration and toggle on "Use your own Developer App"

Enter your ClientID and ClientSecret and save the integration.

Now you can use this integration and the user in auth flow should see the custom developer app.
