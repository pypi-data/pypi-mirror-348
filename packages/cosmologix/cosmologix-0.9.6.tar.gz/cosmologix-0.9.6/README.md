# Cosmologix

**Cosmologix** is a Python package for computing cosmological distances
in a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) universe using JAX for
high-performance and differentiable computations. This package is
mostly intended to fit the Hubble diagram of the LEMAITRE supernovae
compilation and as such has a slightly different (and smaller) scope
than jax-cosmo, with a focus on accurate and fast luminosity
distances. It has been tested against the CCL.

## Features

- **Cosmological Distance Calculations**: Compute various distances (comoving, luminosity, angular diameter) in an FLRW universe.
- **JAX Integration**: Leverage JAX's automatic differentiation and JIT compilation for performance.
- **Neutrino Contributions**: Account for both relativistic and massive neutrinos in cosmological models.
- **CMB Prior Handling**: Includes geometric priors from CMB and BAO measurements.

## Installation


To install `cosmologix`, you need Python 3.10 or newer. Use pip:

```sh
pip install cosmologix
```

Note: Make sure you have JAX installed, along with its dependencies. If you're using GPU acceleration, ensure CUDA and cuDNN are properly set up.

## Usage
Here's a quick example to get you started (look at the
[tutorial](https://lemaitre.pages.in2p3.fr/cosmologix/basic.html) for
a more complete tour of the available features):

```python
from cosmologix import distances, parameters
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Best-fit parameters to Planck 2018 are:
print(parameters.Planck18)

# Redshift values for supernovae
z_values = jnp.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10)

# Compute distance modulus 
distance_modulus = distances.mu(parameters.Planck18, z_values)
print(distance_modulus)

# Find bestfit flat w-CDM cosmology
from cosmologix import likelihoods, fitter
priors = [likelihoods.Planck2018(), likelihoods.DES5yr()]
fixed = {'Omega_k':0., 'm_nu':0.06, 'Neff':3.046, 'Tcmb': 2.7255, 'wa':0.0}

result = fitter.fit(priors, fixed=fixed, verbose=True)
print(result['bestfit'])

# Compute frequentist confidence contours
# The progress bar provides a rough upper bound on computation time because 
# the actual size of the explored region is unknown at the start of the calculation.
# Improvements to this feature are planned.

from cosmologix import contours, display
grid = contours.frequentist_contour_2d_sparse(
    priors,
    grid={'Omega_bc': [0.18, 0.48, 30], 'w': [-0.6, -1.5, 30]},
    fixed=fixed
    )

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
display.plot_contours(grid, filled=True, label='CMB+SN')
plt.ion()
plt.legend(loc='lower right', frameon=False)
plt.show()
#Further examples can be found reading files in the examples directory, especially example/features.py.
```

## Command line interface

For most common use cases, there is also a simple command line interface to the library. You can perform fit, contour exploration and contour plotting as follows:

```bash
# First line is optional. It activates command line completion for most common shells
cosmologix --install-completion
cosmologix fit --priors PR4 --priors DESIDR2 --cosmology FwCDM -s
cosmologix explore Omega_bc w --priors PR4 --priors DESIDR2 --cosmology FwCDM -o contours.pkl
cosmologix contour contours.pkl -s -o contour.png
```

## Dependencies

- JAX for numerical computations and automatic differentiation.
- NumPy for array operations (used indirectly via JAX).
- Matplotlib for plotting.
- Requests to retrieve external data files.
- tqdm to display progression of contour computation
- typer for the cli.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Conversion of contours to different parameterisation (e.g. `Omega_bc` to `Omega_m`)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Here are some guidelines:

- Follow PEP 8 style. The commited code has to go through black.
- Write clear commit messages.
- Include tests for new features or bug fixes.

## Documentation

The complete documentation is available [here](https://lemaitre.pages.in2p3.fr/cosmologix/home.html).
