**GoHumanLoop** is a comprehensive Python library that enables AI agents to seamlessly interact with humans for assistance, feedback, and approvals. It provides a flexible framework for integrating human intelligence into AI workflows through various communication channels.

With GoHumanLoop, developers can create `AI Agent systems` that know when to pause and request human input, ensuring safer and more effective AI operations. The library supports multiple interaction providers (Terminal, Email, API ..etc) and integrates with popular frameworks like LangGraph, and CrewAI(will soon).
