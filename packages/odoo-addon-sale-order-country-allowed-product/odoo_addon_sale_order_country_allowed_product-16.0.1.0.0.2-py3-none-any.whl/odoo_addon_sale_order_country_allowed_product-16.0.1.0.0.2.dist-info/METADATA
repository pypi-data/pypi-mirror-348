Configuration
=============

To select the countries in which a product is available you need to:

- Go to a product template form view.
- Select the countries in which the product is available in field "Sale Allowed Countries".

Users in group "Ignore products sale countries" will gain access to all salable products in sale orders, even to those that are not available in the shipping addres country.

Usage
=====

Users in "Ignore products sale countries" group will be able to select all the salable products in sale order lines, even those that are not available in the country of the shipping address. Users who do not belong to that group, will only be able to select the products available in the country of the shipping address. Products with the "Sale Allowed Countries" field empty are considered to be available in all countries.

A message on the top of the sale order will be displayed if the sale order contains unavailable products.

Users who do not belong to the "Ignore products sale countries" group will be unable to confirm sale orders containing unavailable products.
