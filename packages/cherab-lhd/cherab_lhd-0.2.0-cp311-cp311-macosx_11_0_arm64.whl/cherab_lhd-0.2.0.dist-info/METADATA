## Get Started

### Task-based execution
We offer some tasks to execute programs in CLI.
You can see the list of tasks using [pixi](https://pixi.sh) command.

```shell
pixi task list
```

If you want to execute a task, you can use the following command.

```shell
pixi run <task_name>
```

### Notebooks
We provide some notebooks to demonstrate the usage of the CHERAB-LHD code.
To launch the Jupyter lab server, you can use the following command.

```shell
pixi run lab
```
Then, you can access the Jupyter lab server from your web browser.

## Documentation
The [documentation](https://cherab-lhd.readthedocs.io/) is made with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).
There are two versions of the documentation:
- [Development](https://cherab-lhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Release](https://cherab-lhd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

You can build the documentation locally by running the following command.

```shell
pixi run doc-build
```
