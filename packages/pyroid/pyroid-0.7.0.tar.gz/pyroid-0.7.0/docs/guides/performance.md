# Performance Considerations

This guide provides information on optimizing performance when using Pyroid.

## Overview

Pyroid is designed to provide high-performance implementations of common operations in Python. While it offers significant performance improvements over pure Python implementations, there are several considerations to keep in mind to get the best performance.

## General Performance Tips

### Use Appropriate Data Structures

- Use the right data structure for your task. Pyroid's specialized data structures are optimized for specific operations.
- For large datasets, consider using Pyroid's DataFrame implementation instead of dictionaries or lists.

### Minimize Data Conversion

- Avoid unnecessary conversions between Python and Rust data structures.
- When possible, perform multiple operations in Rust before converting back to Python.

### Batch Processing

- Process data in batches rather than one item at a time.
- Use Pyroid's collection operations (filter, map, reduce) for batch processing.

## Module-Specific Optimizations

### Math Operations

- For vector and matrix operations, use Pyroid's Vector and Matrix classes instead of lists or NumPy arrays for small to medium-sized data.
- For very large matrices, NumPy might still be more efficient due to its optimized C implementation and SIMD instructions.

```python
# Efficient
v1 = pyroid.math.Vector([1, 2, 3])
v2 = pyroid.math.Vector([4, 5, 6])
result = v1 + v2

# Less efficient for small vectors
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = [list1[i] + list2[i] for i in range(len(list1))]
```

### String Operations

- For large text processing tasks, use Pyroid's text functions instead of Python's built-in string methods.
- For very small strings, Python's built-in methods might be faster due to the overhead of crossing the Python-Rust boundary.

```python
# Efficient for large texts
large_text = "Hello, world! " * 10000
reversed_text = pyroid.text.reverse(large_text)

# More efficient for small texts
small_text = "Hello, world!"
reversed_text = small_text[::-1]
```

### Data Operations

- Use Pyroid's filter, map, and reduce functions for large collections.
- For small collections, Python's built-in functions might be more efficient.

```python
# Efficient for large collections
large_list = list(range(1000000))
even_numbers = pyroid.data.filter(large_list, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)

# More efficient for small collections
small_list = list(range(10))
even_numbers = [x for x in small_list if x % 2 == 0]
```

### I/O Operations

- Use Pyroid's I/O functions for reading and writing large files.
- For small files, Python's built-in functions might be more efficient.
- Use async I/O operations for I/O-bound tasks.

```python
# Efficient for large files
large_file_content = pyroid.io.read_file("large_file.txt")

# Efficient for multiple files
files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"]
contents = pyroid.io.read_files(files)
```

### Image Processing

- Use Pyroid's image functions for basic image processing tasks.
- For more complex image processing, consider using specialized libraries like OpenCV or PIL.

```python
# Basic image processing
img = pyroid.image.basic.create_image(100, 100, 3)
grayscale_img = img.to_grayscale()
```

### Machine Learning

- Use Pyroid's ML functions for basic machine learning tasks.
- For more complex machine learning, consider using specialized libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

```python
# Basic clustering
data = [[1.0, 2.0], [1.5, 1.8], [5.0, 8.0], [8.0, 8.0], [1.0, 0.6], [9.0, 11.0]]
kmeans_result = pyroid.ml.basic.kmeans(data, k=2)
```

## Configuration Options

Pyroid provides configuration options that can be used to optimize performance:

```python
# Create a config object
config = pyroid.core.Config()

# Enable parallel processing
config.set("parallel", True)

# Set chunk size for parallel processing
config.set("chunk_size", 1000)
```

### Parallel Processing

- Enable parallel processing for CPU-bound tasks.
- Set an appropriate chunk size based on your data size and CPU cores.
- For small datasets, parallel processing might introduce overhead.

### Memory Management

- Set appropriate buffer sizes for I/O operations.
- Use streaming operations for large datasets that don't fit in memory.

## Benchmarking

Always benchmark your code to ensure you're getting the best performance:

```python
import time
import pyroid

def benchmark(func, *args, **kwargs):
    """Simple benchmarking function."""
    start_time = time.time()
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Time taken: {(end_time - start_time) * 1000:.2f} ms")
    return result

# Benchmark Pyroid function
numbers = list(range(1000000))
result = benchmark(pyroid.data.filter, numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
```

## Conclusion

Pyroid offers significant performance improvements over pure Python implementations, but it's important to use it appropriately based on your specific use case. For small datasets or simple operations, Python's built-in functions might be more efficient due to the overhead of crossing the Python-Rust boundary. For large datasets or complex operations, Pyroid's Rust-powered implementations can provide substantial performance benefits.

Always benchmark your code to ensure you're getting the best performance, and consider the trade-offs between development time, code readability, and execution speed.
