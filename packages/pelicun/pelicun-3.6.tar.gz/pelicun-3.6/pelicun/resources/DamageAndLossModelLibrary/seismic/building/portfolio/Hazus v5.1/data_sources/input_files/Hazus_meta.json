				"Description": "Ground Failure",
				"Comment": "Under Ground Failure, separate fragility curves distinguish between damages due to lateral spreading and ground settlement. Only Extensive and Complete damage states are considered. In essence, buildings are assumed to be either undamaged or severely damaged due to ground failure. In fact, Slight or Moderate damage can occur due to ground failure, but the likelihood of this damage is considered to be small (relative to ground shaking damage) and tacitly included in predictions of Slight or Moderate damage due to ground shaking by STR or LF components. There is no available relationship between the likelihood of Extensive/Complete damage to buildings and PGD. Engineering judgment has been used to develop a set of assumptions which define building fragility.\nNo attempt is made to distinguish damage based on building type, since model building descriptions do not include foundation type. Foundation type is critical to PGD performance and buildings on deep foundations (e.g., piles) perform much better than buildings on spread footings, if the ground settles. When the building is known to be supported by a deep foundation, the probability of Extensive or Complete damage is reduced by a factor of 10 from that predicted for settlement-induced damage of the same building on a shallow foundation. Deep foundations will improve building performance by only a limited amount if the ground spreads laterally. When the building is known to be supported by a deep foundation, the probability of Extensive or Complete damage is reduced by a factor of 2 from that predicted for spread-induced damage of the same building on a shallow foundation.",

				"Description": "Lifeline Facilities",
				"Comment": "Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.

These buildings may have relatively heavy masonry chimneys and may be partially or fully covered with masonry veneer. Most of these buildings, especially the single-family residences, are not engineered but constructed in accordance with “conventional construction” provisions of building codes. Hence, they usually have the components of a lateral-force-resisting system even though it may be incomplete. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to shear walls. The diaphragms are roof panels and floors that may be sheathed with sawn lumber, plywood or fiberboard sheathing. Shear walls are sheathed with boards, stucco, plaster, plywood, gypsum board, particle board, or fiberboard, or interior partition walls sheathed with plaster or gypsum board.",

Usually, the structure is concealed on the outside by exterior nonstructural walls, which can be of almost any material (curtain walls, brick masonry, or precast concrete panels), and on the inside by ceilings and column furring. Diaphragms transfer lateral loads to moment-resisting frames. The diaphragms can be almost any material. The frames develop their stiffness by full or partial moment connections. The frames can be located almost anywhere in the building. Usually, the columns have their strong directions oriented so that some columns act primarily in one direction while the others act in the other direction.

	        	"Comment": "Structural System: These buildings have a wood or metal deck roof diaphragm, which often is very large, that distributes lateral forces to precast concrete shear walls. The walls are thin but relatively heavy, while the roofs are relatively light. Older or non-seismic-code buildings often have inadequate connections for anchorage of the walls to the roof for out-of-plane forces, and the panel connections are often brittle. Tilt-up buildings are usually one or two stories in height. Walls can have numerous openings for doors and windows of such size that the wall looks more like a frame than a shear wall.",

					"DS1": "Slight Structural Damage: Diagonal hairline cracks on concrete shear wall surfaces; larger cracks around door and window openings in walls with a large proportion of openings; minor concrete spalling at a few locations; minor separation of walls from the floor and roof diaphragms; hairline cracks around metal connectors between wall panels and at connections of beams to walls.",
					"DS2": "Moderate Structural Damage: Most wall surfaces exhibit diagonal cracks; larger cracks in walls with door or window openings; a few shear walls have exceeded their yield capacities, as indicated by larger diagonal cracks and concrete spalling. Cracks may appear at top of walls near panel intersections, indicating “chord” yielding. Some walls may have visibly pulled away from the roof. Some welded panel connections may have been broken, as indicated by spalled concrete around connections. Some spalling may be observed at the connections of beams to walls.",
					"DS3": "Extensive Structural Damage: In buildings with relatively large area of wall openings, most concrete shear walls have exceeded their yield capacities, and some have exceeded their ultimate capacities as indicated by large, through-the-wall diagonal cracks, extensive spalling around the cracks, and visibly buckled wall reinforcement. The plywood diaphragms may exhibit cracking and separation along plywood joints. Partial collapse of the roof may result from the failure of the wall-to-diaphragm anchorages sometimes with falling of wall panels.",
					"DS4": "Complete Structural Damage: Structure is collapsed or is in imminent danger of collapse due to failure of the wall-to-roof anchorages, splitting of ledgers, or failure of plywood-to-ledger nailing, failure of beam connections at walls, failure of roof or floor diaphragms, or failure of the wall panels.",

Precast concrete girders and columns support the diaphragms. The girders often bear on column corbels. Closure strips between precast floor elements and beam-column joints are usually cast-in-place concrete. Welded steel inserts are often used to interconnect precast elements. Precast or cast-in-place concrete shear walls resist lateral loads. For buildings with precast frames and concrete shear walls to perform well, the details used to connect the structural elements must have sufficient strength and displacement capacity; however, in some cases, the connection details between the precast elements have negligible ductility.",

	        	"Comment": "Structural System: These buildings include structural elements that vary depending on the building’s age and, to a lesser extent, its geographic location. In buildings built before 1900, the majority of floor and roof construction consists of wood sheathing supported by wood framing. In large multistory buildings, the floors are cast- in-place concrete supported by the unreinforced masonry walls and/or steel or concrete interior framing. In unreinforced masonry constructed built after 1950 outside California, wood floors usually have plywood rather than board sheathing. In regions of lower seismicity, buildings of this type constructed more recently can include floor and roof framing that consists of metal deck and concrete fill supported by steel framing elements. The perimeter walls, and possibly some interior walls, are unreinforced masonry. The walls may or may not be anchored to the diaphragms. Ties between the walls and diaphragms are more common for the bearing walls than for walls that are parallel to the floor framing. Roof ties are usually less common and more erratically spaced than those at the floor levels. Interior partitions that interconnect the floors and roof can reduce diaphragm displacements.",
