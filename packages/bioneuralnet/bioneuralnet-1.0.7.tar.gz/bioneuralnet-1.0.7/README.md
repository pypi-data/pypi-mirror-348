## 1. Installation

BioNeuralNet supports Python 3.10 and 3.11.

### 1.1. Install BioNeuralNet
```bash
pip install bioneuralnet
```

## 1.2. Install PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric
BioNeuralNet relies on PyTorch for GNN computations. Install PyTorch separately:

- **PyTorch (CPU)**:
  ```bash
  pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
  ```

- **PyTorch Geometric**:
  ```bash
  pip install torch_geometric
  ```

For GPU acceleration, please refer to:
- [PyTorch Installation Guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [PyTorch Geometric Installation Guide](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)


## 2. BioNeuralNet Core Features

For an End-to-End example example of BioNeuralNet, see [BioNeuralNet Demo](https://bioneuralnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/BioNeuralNet.html)

**Network Embedding**:

- Given a multi-omics network as input, BioNeuralNet can generate embeddings using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
- Generate embeddings using methods such as **GCN**, **GAT**, **GraphSAGE**, and **GIN**.
- Outputs can be obtained as native tensors or converted to pandas DataFrames for easy analysis and visualization.
- Embeddings unlock numerous downstream applications, including disease prediction, enhanced subject representation, clustering, and more.

**Graph Clustering**:

- Identify functional modules or communities using **correlated clustering methods** (e.g., CorrelatedPageRank, CorrelatedLouvain, HybridLouvain) that integrate phenotype correlation to extract biologically relevant modules [1]_.
- Clustering methods can be applied to any network represented allowing flexible analysis across different domains.
- All clustering components return either raw partitions dictionaries or induced subnetwork adjacency matrices (as DataFrames) for visualization.
- Use cases include, feature selection, biomarker discovery, and network-based analysis.

**Downstream Tasks**:

- **Subject Representation**:

   - Integrate node embeddings back into omics data to enrich subject-level profiles by weighting features with learned embedding.
   - This embedding-enriched data can be used for downstream tasks such as disease prediction or biomarker discovery.
   - The result can be returned as a DataFrame or a PyTorch tensor, fitting naturally into downstream analyses.

- **Disease Prediction for Multi-Omics Network DPMON**:

   - Classification End-to-End pipeline for disease prediction using Graph Neural Network embeddings.
   - DPMON supports hyperparameter tuning-when enabled, it finds the best for the given data.
   - This approach, along with the native pandas integration across modules, ensures that BioNeuralNet can be easily incorporated into your analysis workflows.

**Metrics**:

- Several plotting funcctions to visualize networks, emebddings, variance distribution, cluster comparison, and more.
- Correlation based functions to compare clustersand omics data with the phenotype.

**Utilities**:
   
- **Filtering Functions**:

   - Network filtering allows users to select variance or zero-fraction filtering to an omics network.
   - Reducing noise, and removing outliers.

- **Data Conversion**:

   - Convert RData files both CSV and to Pandas DataFrame. For ease of integration for R-based workflows.

**External Tools**:

- **Graph Construction**:

   - BioNeuralNet provides additional tools in the [External Tools](https://bioneuralnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/external_tools/index.html) module.
   - Allowing users to generate networks using R-based tools like WGCNA and SmCCNet.
   - While optional, these tools enhance BioNeuralNet's capabilities and are recommended for comprehensive analysis.

## 3. Quick Example: SmCCNet + DPMON for Disease Prediction

```python
import pandas as pd
from bioneuralnet.datasets import DatasetLoader
from bioneuralnet.external_tools import SmCCNet
from bioneuralnet.downstream_task import DPMON

# 1. Load dataset
loader = DatasetLoader("example1")
omics1, omics2, phenotype, clinical = loader.load_data()

# 2. Generate adjacency matrix using SmCCNet
smccnet = SmCCNet(
    phenotype_df=phenotype,
    omics_dfs=[omics1, omics2],
    data_types=["genes", "proteins"],
    kfold=3,
    subSampNum=500,
)
global_network, _ = smccnet.run()

# 3. Run Disease Prediction using DPMON
dpmon = DPMON(
    adjacency_matrix=global_network,
    omics_list=[omics1, omics2],
    phenotype_data=phenotype,
    clinical_data=clinical,
    tune=True,
)
dpmon_predictions = dpmon.run()
print("Disease Predictions:\n", dpmon_predictions.head())
```

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Does BioNeuralNet support GPU acceleration?**  
  Yes, install PyTorch with CUDA support.

- **Can I use my own omics network?**  
  Yes, you can provide a custom network as an adjancy matrix instead of using SmCCNet.
