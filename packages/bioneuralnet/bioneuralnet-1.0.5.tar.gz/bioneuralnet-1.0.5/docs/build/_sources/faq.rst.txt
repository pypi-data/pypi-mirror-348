Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

**Q1: What is BioNeuralNet?**  
A1: BioNeuralNet is a Python framework for integrating multi-omics data with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It provides end-to-end solutions for network embedding, clustering, subject representation, and disease prediction.

**Q2: What are the key features of BioNeuralNet?**  
A2:  
- **Graph Clustering:** Identify communities using Correlated Louvain, Hybrid Louvain, and Correlated PageRank methods.  
- **GNN Embedding:** Generate node embeddings using advanced GNN models.  
- **Subject Representation:** Enrich omics data with learned embeddings.  
- **Disease Prediction:** Leverage DPMON for integrated, end-to-end disease prediction.

**Q3: How do I install BioNeuralNet?**  
A3: Install via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install bioneuralnet

For full installation instructions, see the :doc:`installation` guide.

**Q4: Does BioNeuralNet support GPU acceleration?**  
A4: Yes. If a CUDA-compatible GPU is available, BioNeuralNet will utilize it via PyTorch.

**Q5: Can I use my own network instead of SmCCNet?**  
A5: Absolutely. You can supply a pre-computed adjacency matrix directly to the GNNEmbedding or DPMON modules.

**Q6: How is DPMON different from standard GNN models?**  
A6: DPMON is tailored for multi-omics disease prediction by jointly learning node embeddings and a classifier, integrating both local and global graph structures.

**Q7: What clustering methods does BioNeuralNet support?**  
A7: BioNeuralNet offers:  
- Correlated Louvain  
- Hybrid Louvain  
- Correlated PageRank

**Q8: How can I contribute to BioNeuralNet?**  
A8: Contributions are encouraged! Fork the repository, develop your feature, and submit a pull request. See our contribution guidelines on GitHub.

**Q9: Where can I find tutorials and examples?**  
A9: For detailed guides and demos, visit :doc:`tutorials/index` and check out the example notebooks provided in the repository.

**Q10: What license is BioNeuralNet released under?**
