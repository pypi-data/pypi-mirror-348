    """Analyze the potential impact of changes to a component.

    This method identifies components that may be affected by changes to the
    specified component, based on historical co-change patterns and explicit
    dependencies in the knowledge graph. It helps predict the "blast radius"
    of changes, which is useful for planning refactoring efforts, assessing risk,
    and understanding the architecture of your codebase.

    The impact analysis uses a sophisticated dynamic scoring system that considers:

    1. Relationship Strength:
       - Type of dependency (DEPENDS_ON, IMPORTS, USES, REFERENCES, etc.)
       - Direction of relationship (outgoing vs incoming)
       - Edge properties (frequency, confidence, etc.)

    2. Component Importance:
       - Node type (ADR, ISSUE, PR, COMMIT, FILE, etc.)
       - Centrality in the graph (number of connections)
       - Historical significance (age, number of modifications)

    3. Architectural Context:
       - Component location in architecture (SYSTEM, SERVICE, COMPONENT)
       - System boundary crossings
       - Critical paths

    4. Co-Change Patterns:
       - Frequency of co-changes
       - Recency of co-changes
       - Consistency of co-change patterns

    Args:
        adapter: The database adapter to use for querying the knowledge graph.
        component_id: The ID of the component to analyze. This can be a file, directory,
            module, or any other component in your codebase. Format should be
            "type:identifier", e.g., "file:src/auth/login.py".
        impact_types: Types of impact to include in the analysis. Options are:
            - "direct": Components that directly depend on or are depended upon by the target
            - "indirect": Components connected through a chain of dependencies
            - "potential": Components that historically changed together with the target
            If None, all impact types will be included.
        max_depth: Maximum depth of indirect dependency analysis. Higher values will
            analyze more distant dependencies but may take longer. Values between
            2-5 are recommended for most codebases.
        callback: Optional callback function for progress reporting. If provided,
            it will be called at various stages of the analysis with progress updates.

    Returns:
        A list of ImpactResult objects representing affected components. Each result
        includes the component ID, type, title, impact type, impact score (0-1),
        and the path of dependencies from the target component. The impact_score
        is dynamically calculated based on the factors described above, and the
        properties field contains detailed information about the scoring factors.

    Raises:
        QueryError: If the impact analysis fails due to database errors, invalid
            component ID, or other issues. The error message will include details
            about what went wrong and how to fix it.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Analyze impact on a file
        results = analyze_component_impact(
            adapter=db_adapter,
            component_id="file:src/auth/login.py",
