# PR Comment Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement a high-value PR comment integration for Arc Memory. The goal is to provide developers with unique, actionable insights about their code changes directly in GitHub pull requests.

## Key Objectives

1. **Deliver Unique Insights**: Provide information that developers wouldn't otherwise consider
2. **Focus on High Value**: Prioritize quality over quantity of insights
3. **Seamless Integration**: Make setup and configuration as simple as possible
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Present information in a clear, digestible format

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. GitHub Actions Integration

#### 1.1 Basic Workflow Template

- **Implementation**: Create a reusable GitHub Actions workflow
  - Support for different repository structures
  - Configurable thresholds and analysis types
  - Caching for performance optimization

- **Example Configuration**:
  ```yaml
  name: Arc Memory PR Review
  
  on:
    pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize]
  
  jobs:
    arc-memory-analysis:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          with:
            fetch-depth: 0
        - uses: arc-computer/setup-arc-memory@v1
        - uses: arc-computer/arc-pr-comment@v1
          with:
            github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            analysis-depth: standard
  ```

#### 1.2 Composite Actions

- **Implementation**: Create composite GitHub Actions
  - `arc-computer/setup-arc-memory@v1`: Install and configure Arc Memory
  - `arc-computer/arc-pr-comment@v1`: Analyze PR and post comment

- **Features**:
  - Automatic authentication
  - Configurable analysis depth
  - Support for different comment modes

### 2. High-Value Insight Generation

#### 2.1 Insight Types

- **Implementation**: Focus on these high-value insight types:
  - **Architectural Impact**: How changes affect system architecture
  - **Hidden Dependencies**: Non-obvious dependencies affected by changes
  - **Historical Context**: Why code exists and previous issues
  - **Security Implications**: Potential security impacts
  - **Performance Considerations**: Possible performance effects

- **Example Insights**:
  ```
  üèóÔ∏è Architectural Impact: This change modifies a core authentication component used by 5 other services.
  
  üîç Hidden Dependency: While this change looks isolated, it affects the error handling path used by the payment processing system.
  
  üìú Historical Context: This code was refactored 3 months ago to fix CVE-2023-1234. Your changes reintroduce a similar pattern.
  
  üîí Security Implication: This change modifies input validation logic that protects against XSS attacks.
  
  ‚ö° Performance Consideration: This query runs in a hot loop and could benefit from caching.
  ```

#### 2.2 Insight Selection Algorithm

- **Implementation**: Create an algorithm to select the most valuable insights
  - Score insights based on severity, confidence, and relevance
  - Only show insights above configurable thresholds
  - Limit to 3-5 insights per PR for focus

- **Scoring Factors**:
  - Severity of potential issues
  - Confidence in the analysis
  - Relevance to the specific changes
  - Historical accuracy of similar insights

#### 2.3 LLM-Enhanced Analysis

- **Implementation**: Use LLMs to generate deeper insights
  - Analyze code changes in context of the knowledge graph
  - Generate natural language explanations
  - Provide specific, actionable recommendations

- **Example Prompt**:
  ```
  Analyze these code changes in the context of the knowledge graph:
  
  1. What architectural components are affected?
  2. Are there any non-obvious dependencies?
  3. What historical context is relevant?
  4. Are there security implications?
  5. Could there be performance impacts?
  
  For each insight, provide:
  1. A clear, concise description
  2. Evidence from the knowledge graph
  3. A specific, actionable recommendation
  ```

### 3. Comment Design and Formatting

#### 3.1 Progressive Disclosure Format

- **Implementation**: Design a comment format that uses progressive disclosure
  - High-level summary at the top
  - Expandable sections for details
  - Links to more comprehensive analysis

- **Example Structure**:
  ```markdown
  ## Arc Memory Analysis
  
  This PR modifies **5 files** with potential impact on **3 components**.
  
  ### Key Insights
  
  üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Impact**: This change affects the authentication system.
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
  The `AuthService` is used by 5 other components:
  - UserService
  - PaymentProcessor
  - NotificationSystem
  - AdminPanel
  - APIGateway
  
  **Recommendation**: Consider adding tests for each affected component.
  </details>
  
  üîç **Hidden Dependency**: Non-obvious dependency on error handling.
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
  While this change appears isolated, it modifies an error handling path that's
  used by the payment processing system during transaction failures.
  
  **Recommendation**: Test the payment failure scenario.
  </details>
  
  ### Decision Trail
  
  <details>
  <summary>Why does this code exist?</summary>
  
  This authentication system was implemented after security incident #123.
  Key decisions:
  1. Use JWT for stateless authentication
  2. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force
  3. Add refresh token rotation for security

  </details>
  ```

#### 3.2 Comment Management

- **Implementation**: Implement intelligent comment management
  - Create new comment if none exists
  - Update existing comment when new commits are pushed
  - Support different comment modes (create/update/replace)

- **Configuration Options**:
  ```yaml
  comment-mode: update  # create, update, or replace
  comment-position: top  # top or bottom of PR
  include-summary: true  # include high-level summary
  include-details: true  # include expandable details
  ```

#### 3.3 Feedback Mechanism

- **Implementation**: Add user feedback collection
  - Add reaction buttons to comments
  - Track which insights users find valuable
  - Use feedback to improve future analysis

- **Example Feedback Section**:
  ```markdown
  ### Feedback
  
  Was this analysis helpful? React to this comment:
  - üëç Helpful insights
  - üëé Not useful
  - üéØ Found an issue
  - ü§î Needs more context
  ```

### 4. CLI Integration

#### 4.1 CI Command Group

- **Implementation**: Create a dedicated `arc ci` command group
  ```bash
  # Analyze a PR and generate insights
  arc ci analyze --pr <PR_NUMBER> --output-format markdown
  
  # Post a comment to a PR
  arc ci comment --pr <PR_NUMBER> --comment-file <FILE>
  
  # Refresh the knowledge graph incrementally
  arc ci refresh --incremental --parallel
  ```

#### 4.2 Export Command Enhancement

- **Implementation**: Enhance the export command for CI usage
  ```bash
  # Export graph slice for a PR
  arc export --pr-sha <SHA> --output-path analysis.json --compress --optimize-for-llm
  ```
