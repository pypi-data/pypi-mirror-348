### Core Components

#### 1. Environment

The environment represents the codebase and its context:

- **Repository Structure**: Files, directories, dependencies
- **Code Semantics**: AST, control flow, data flow
- **Metadata**: Commit history, PR information, issue links
- **System Architecture**: Component relationships, deployment configuration
- **External Context**: Documentation, discussions, requirements

#### 2. State Representation

The state is represented by our knowledge graph:

- **Nodes**: Code entities (functions, classes, variables), artifacts (commits, PRs, issues)
- **Edges**: Relationships between entities (calls, imports, modifies)
- **Temporal Dimension**: Historical states and changes over time
- **Causal Links**: Decision → implication → code change relationships
- **Embeddings**: Vector representations of code and context

#### 3. Action Space

The action space consists of prediction types our system can make:

- **Vulnerability Predictions**: Identifying potential security issues
- **Blast Radius Predictions**: Determining affected components
- **Behavior Predictions**: Forecasting runtime behavior changes
- **Risk Assessments**: Evaluating potential negative outcomes
- **Mitigation Suggestions**: Recommending preventive measures

#### 4. Agent

The agent is our prediction engine that learns to make accurate forecasts:

- **Multi-stage Reasoning**: Breaking down complex predictions into steps (inspired by SWiRL)
- **Architecture-specific Models**: Specialized models for different system types
- **Confidence Estimation**: Providing uncertainty measures with predictions
- **Explanation Generation**: Producing human-readable rationales

#### 5. Reward Function

The reward function evaluates prediction quality based on actual outcomes:

- **Accuracy Rewards**: Higher rewards for correct predictions
- **Precision/Recall Balance**: Penalties for false positives/negatives
- **Timeliness Rewards**: Higher rewards for early detection
- **Impact-weighted Scoring**: Higher rewards for high-impact predictions
- **Explanation Quality**: Rewards for clear, actionable explanations

#### 6. Policy

The policy determines the prediction strategy:

- **Risk-sensitive Policy**: Adjusts confidence thresholds based on potential impact
- **Context-aware Policy**: Considers repository-specific patterns and history
- **Adaptive Policy**: Evolves based on feedback and outcomes
- **Multi-objective Policy**: Balances different prediction goals
