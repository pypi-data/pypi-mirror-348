# Reinforcement Learning Pipeline Implementation

This PR implements a baseline reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline for Arc Memory to predict blast radius and vulnerabilities in code components.

## Current Implementation

### Components
- Environment (`environment.py`): Represents the codebase state through Arc knowledge graph
- Agent (`agent.py`): Q-table based agent with epsilon-greedy policy
- Reward (`reward.py`): Multi-component reward function
- Training (`training.py`): Training loop and experience collection
- Runner (`run.py`): CLI interface for training, evaluation, and demo

### Results

The initial training results show:

1. Training Metrics:
   - Episodes: 100
   - Average Reward: ~40.71
   - Average Episode Length: 100 (maximum length)
   - Reward Range: [38.68, 42.38]
   - Rewards showed upward trend during training

2. Demo Performance:
   - Agent focuses on blast radius predictions
   - Limited exploration of vulnerability predictions
   - Zero rewards common, suggesting reward function needs tuning
   - Agent shows pattern of repeating similar actions

### Generated Artifacts
- Model checkpoints saved every 10 episodes in `models/`
- Training plots in `plots/`:
  - Episode rewards
  - Episode lengths
  - Action counts
  - Reward components

## Running the Pipeline

1. Training Mode:
```bash
python -m arc_memory.rl.run --mode train --num_episodes 100 --agent_type qtable --save_dir models --plot_dir plots
```

2. Demo Mode:
```bash
python -m arc_memory.rl.run --mode demo --agent_type qtable --agent_path models/agent_episode_100.json --num_steps 10
```

3. Evaluation Mode:
```bash
python -m arc_memory.rl.run --mode evaluate --agent_type qtable --agent_path models/agent_episode_100.json --num_episodes 5
```

## Immediate Improvements Needed

1. Reward Function Enhancement:
   - Current rewards are sparse (many zeros)
   - Need more granular feedback for agent actions
   - Consider adding intermediate rewards for partial success

2. Environment Fixes:
   - Fix entity details property access error
   - Improve state representation
   - Add more sophisticated component relationships

3. Agent Improvements:
   - Increase action diversity
   - Adjust epsilon for better exploration/exploitation balance
   - Consider using deep Q-learning for better state representation

4. Test Components:
   - Add more diverse test components
   - Include realistic component relationships
   - Add security-related properties

5. Training Process:
   - Implement early stopping
   - Add validation episodes during training
   - Save best model based on validation performance

## Next Steps

1. Implement reward function improvements:
   - Add component complexity metric
   - Consider historical change patterns
   - Weight different reward components

2. Fix environment issues:
   - Update entity details handling
   - Add proper component properties
   - Improve state representation

3. Enhance agent:
   - Implement DQN variant
   - Add prioritized experience replay
   - Tune hyperparameters

4. Improve evaluation:
   - Add more metrics
   - Create visualization tools
   - Compare against baselines

## Notes

- Current implementation uses test components when real components not available
- Warning messages about entity details need addressing
- Consider adding OpenAI integration for better component analysis
- Monitor training time and resource usage for optimization
