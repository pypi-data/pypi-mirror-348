# Arc Memory Go-To-Market Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines Arc Memory's go-to-market strategy, focusing on user personas, value propositions, and execution plan. It complements the [Strategic Roadmap](arc_strategic_roadmap.md) by providing specific guidance on market entry and customer acquisition.

## Target Market Segments

Arc Memory is targeting three distinct market segments, with a phased approach to market entry:

1. **Primary (Initial Focus)**: Open Source Maintainers in blockchain/infrastructure
2. **Secondary (Mid-term)**: Staff Engineers at mid-market fintech/blockchain companies
3. **Tertiary (Horizon)**: Frontier/Power Users with existing agent stacks

## User Stories and Pain Points

### Primary: Open Source Maintainer

```bash
As an open source maintainer responsible for large infrastructure,
I need to quickly understand the context and implications of code changes,
So that I can effectively review PRs, respond to incidents, and maintain system integrity despite being overwhelmed.
```

**Key Pain Points:**
- Managing context across multiple repositories and components
- Understanding changes made by infrequent contributors
- Remembering why certain design decisions were made
- Quickly getting up to speed during incidents
- Handling large volumes of PRs with limited bandwidth
- Onboarding new contributors efficiently

**Value Proposition:**
- Automatic context building and maintenance (auto-refresh)
- Decision trail preservation and retrieval (arc why)
- Relationship mapping between components (arc relate)
- Reduced MTTR during incidents
- More efficient code review process

**Lighthouse Customer**: Protocol Labs (Filecoin and IPFS)

### Secondary: Mid-Market Staff Engineer

```bash
As a staff engineer at a mid-market fintech/blockchain company,
I need to de-risk the accelerated pace of AI-generated code changes,
So that I can ensure system stability while embracing AI acceleration.
```

**Key Pain Points:**
- Increased volume of code changes from AI tools
- Difficulty assessing blast radius of changes
- Maintaining system integrity with faster development cycles
- Ensuring security and compliance in a rapidly evolving codebase
- Preserving architectural decisions across team changes

**Value Proposition:**
- Blast radius prediction for proposed changes
- Causal relationship mapping across the codebase
- CI integration for automated analysis
- Security vulnerability detection
- Institutional memory preservation

**Target Companies**: QuickNode, NEAR Protocol, similar fintech startups

### Tertiary: Frontier/Power Users

```bash
As a power user with an existing agent stack,
I need shared memory across my agents,
So that they can collaborate effectively on complex tasks.
```

**Key Pain Points:**
- Lack of coordination between agents
- Duplicated work and conflicting changes
- No persistent memory across agent sessions
- Difficulty scaling agent workflows to complex systems
- Limited understanding of system-wide implications

**Value Proposition:**
- SDK for agent integration
- Shared knowledge graph for agent coordination
- Temporal analysis for understanding system evolution
- Multi-agent coordination protocols
- Proactive system understanding

## Value Metrics

Arc Memory delivers value across three key dimensions, with varying frequency and impact:

1. **MTTR / Incident Response**
   - **Frequency**: Less frequent (1-2x per month)
   - **Impact**: Very high (potentially $15k/min saved during outages)
   - **Measurement**: Reduction in time to resolution for incidents
   - **Target**: 30-50% reduction in MTTR

2. **Code Contextual Intelligence**
   - **Frequency**: Daily
   - **Impact**: Medium (saves 30-60 min per day per developer)
   - **Measurement**: Time saved during development tasks
   - **Target**: 10-15% increase in developer productivity

3. **Code Review**
   - **Frequency**: Multiple times per week
   - **Impact**: High (prevents costly bugs, improves code quality)
   - **Measurement**: Reduction in review time, increase in issues caught
   - **Target**: 25% reduction in review time, 15% increase in issues caught

## User Experience: The Happy Path

With core functionality, auto-refresh, and SDK refactoring complete, the ideal user experience ("happy path") for our primary target users would be:

### For OSS Maintainers

1. **Initial Setup (Day 1)**:
   ```bash
   # Install Arc Memory
   pip install arc-memory

   # Authenticate with GitHub
   arc auth gh

   # Build initial knowledge graph for repository
   arc build --github

   # Set up auto-refresh (runs daily at midnight)
   arc refresh --schedule daily
   ```

2. **Daily Usage**:
   - Receive PR for review
   - Run `arc why file path/to/changed/file.py 42` to understand the context and history of the changed code
   - Run `arc relate pr 123` to see how this PR relates to other components and decisions
   - Use insights to provide more informed review comments

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Alert comes in about service degradation
   - Run `arc why service auth-service` to quickly understand recent changes and their rationale
   - Use `arc relate issue 456` to see connections between the reported issue and recent changes
   - Identify root cause significantly faster than traditional debugging

4. **Onboarding Contributors**:
   - New contributor asks about design decision
   - Run `arc why decision "authentication flow"` to retrieve the history and context
   - Share the output with contributor, saving hours of explanation
   - Contributor gets up to speed much faster with full context

### For Staff Engineers (Secondary Target)

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Install Arc Memory
   pip install arc-memory

   # Authenticate with GitHub and Linear
   arc auth gh
   arc auth linear

   # Build comprehensive knowledge graph
   arc build --github --linear --llm-enhancement standard

   # Set up auto-refresh and CI integration
   arc refresh --schedule daily
   arc ci setup --github-actions
   ```

2. **PR Review Workflow**:
   - Receive GitHub notification about new PR with Arc Memory analysis
   - Review blast radius prediction and affected components
   - Use insights to focus code review on high-risk areas
   - Approve or request changes with confidence about system-wide impacts

3. **Architecture Evolution**:
   - Need to understand how a system evolved over time
   - Run `arc timeline service payment-processor --last 6months`
   - Visualize key decision points and their rationale
   - Use insights to guide future architectural decisions

### Key Moments of Delight

1. **"Aha" Moment**: When a maintainer uses `arc why` for the first time and immediately gets context they would have spent hours searching for otherwise.

2. **Trust Moment**: When auto-refresh silently keeps the knowledge graph updated without any manual intervention.

3. **Value Moment**: During an incident, when Arc Memory helps identify the root cause in minutes instead of hours.

4. **Expansion Moment**: When a maintainer introduces Arc Memory to their team and they all start using it for collaborative understanding.

5. **Retention Moment**: When users realize they can't imagine working without Arc Memory after a few weeks of usage.

## Competitive Positioning

Arc Memory will position against competitors by emphasizing:

1. **Vertical Focus**: Built specifically for software engineering workflows, unlike horizontal memory solutions (Letta, Mem0, Zep)

2. **Causal Knowledge**: Captures not just what changed, but why it changed, unlike code context tools (Unblocked)

3. **Temporal Analysis**: Bi-temporal model enables "time travel" through the codebase

4. **Blast Radius Prediction**: Predicts the impact of changes before they're merged

5. **Local-First Architecture**: Ensures privacy and performance while enabling cloud sync when needed

## Conclusion

This go-to-market strategy focuses on delivering immediate value to OSS maintainers while building toward more advanced use cases for mid-market companies and frontier users. By starting with a strong foundation in the open source community, Arc Memory can establish credibility, gather valuable feedback, and refine the product before expanding to commercial customers.

The phased approach acknowledges resource constraints while maximizing impact, focusing first on the user segment where we have the strongest access and leverage. As the product matures, we'll expand to address the needs of staff engineers at mid-market companies and eventually power users with advanced agent workflows.
