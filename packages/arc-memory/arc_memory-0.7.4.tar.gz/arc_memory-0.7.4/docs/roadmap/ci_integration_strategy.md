# Arc Memory CI Integration Strategy

## Vision

Arc Memory is not just another "memory layer." It is the risk-aware world-model for code: a temporal graph + RL engine (trajectories) that agents query to predict blast-radius, security vulnerabilities, and performance regressions before a merge. While competing memory stores retrieve facts, Arc simulates consequences.

> **Core Thesis**: Whoever controls a live, trustworthy memory of the system controls the pace at which they can safely unleash autonomy.

As AI generates exponentially more code, the critical bottleneck shifts from *generation* to *understanding, provenance, and coordination*. The CI environment represents the most data-rich opportunity to build this world model, as it sees everything in the system: code changes, test results, build artifacts, and agent interactions.

## CI Integration Goals

1. **Continuous Knowledge Graph Building**: Automatically update the knowledge graph with each commit, PR, and test run
2. **Risk Assessment**: Predict blast radius and potential issues before code is merged
3. **Agent Coordination**: Enable multiple agents to work together with a shared understanding
4. **Performance Optimization**: Capture agent traces to understand and improve performance
5. **Provenance Tracking**: Record why every change was made and by whom (human or agent)

## Framework-Agnostic and Database-Flexible Approach

Drawing inspiration from NVIDIA's AIQ framework, Neo4j's GraphRAG ecosystem, and GitHub's CodeQL, our CI integration will be both framework-agnostic and database-flexible, treating all components as function calls to enable true composability. This allows teams to use Arc Memory regardless of their agent usage level and database preference (SQLite for individual developers, Neo4j for team-wide collaboration).

### For Traditional Teams

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow for teams with minimal agent usage
name: Arc Memory Integration

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  arc-memory-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up Arc Memory
        uses: arc-computer/setup-arc-memory@v1

      - name: Cache Knowledge Graph
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: .arc/graph.db
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-arc-${{ github.repository }}-${{ hashFiles('.git/HEAD') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-arc-${{ github.repository }}-

      - name: Build Knowledge Graph
        run: arc build --github --incremental

        with:
          comment-file: analysis.md
          comment-mode: update
```

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  arc-memory-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up Arc Memory
        uses: arc-computer/setup-arc-memory@v1

          threshold: medium
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. GitHub Actions Components

1. **Setup Action**: `arc-computer/setup-arc-memory@v1`
   - Installs Arc Memory
   - Configures GitHub authentication using workflow token
   - Sets up necessary environment variables

2. **Analysis Actions**:
   - `arc-computer/arc-blast-radius@v1`: For heuristic-based blast radius prediction
   - `arc-computer/arc-agent-analysis@v1`: For agent-based analysis (Phase 2/3)

3. **Reporting Actions**:
   - `arc-computer/arc-pr-comment@v1`: Posts analysis results as PR comments
     - Supports updating existing comments to avoid noise
     - Configurable thresholds to only post high-signal insights
     - Reaction buttons for user feedback

### 2. Heuristic-Based Blast Radius Prediction

Our heuristic-based approach will focus on providing high-value insights without requiring LLM integration in Phase 1:

1. **Static Dependency Analysis**:
   - Parse import statements and function calls to build a dependency graph
   - Identify direct and transitive dependencies of changed files
   - Calculate centrality metrics to identify critical components

2. **Historical Co-change Analysis**:
   - Analyze commit history to identify files that frequently change together
   - Build a co-change graph to predict likely affected components
   - Identify patterns of changes that historically led to issues

3. **Component Boundary Detection**:
   - Use directory structure and naming conventions to identify logical components
   - Map changes to architectural components in the knowledge graph
   - Identify cross-component changes that have higher risk

4. **Impact Scoring**:
   - Calculate a weighted impact score based on:
     - Number of dependent files/modules
     - Centrality of changed components in the dependency graph
     - Historical co-change patterns
     - Test coverage of affected areas
   - Only report insights that exceed configurable thresholds

### 3. Performance Optimization

Drawing from CodeQL's approach to CI performance, we'll implement:

1. **Incremental Analysis**:
   - Leverage the auto-refresh functionality to build incrementally
   - Only analyze changes since the last analysis
   - Reuse previous analysis results when possible

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache the knowledge graph between workflow runs using GitHub Actions cache
   - Implement optimal cache key strategy based on repository state
   - Use multi-level caching with fallbacks for partial cache hits
   - Implement database-level caching for query results

3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Parallelize graph building for different data sources
   - Process GitHub, Linear, and ADR sources concurrently
   - Use worker pools for dependency analysis
   - Implement batched processing for large repositories

4. **Configurable Depth**:
   - Allow limiting the depth of dependency analysis
   - Provide options to focus on specific directories
   - Support excluding test files or generated code

5. **CI-Specific Optimizations**:
   - Add a `--ci` flag to the refresh command for CI-specific behavior
   - Optimize for headless environments with minimal resource usage
   - Implement CI-specific logging and progress reporting
   - Auto-detect CI environments for default optimizations

### 4. High-Signal PR Comments

To ensure we only provide valuable insights and avoid noise:

1. **Consolidated Comments**:
   - Use a single, well-structured comment instead of multiple comments
   - Update existing comments when new commits are pushed
   - Organize insights by severity and component

2. **Configurable Thresholds**:
   - Only report insights that exceed configurable impact thresholds
   - Allow teams to set their own threshold levels
   - Provide default thresholds based on repository size and complexity

3. **Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Show the most critical insights by default
   - Use expandable sections for additional details
   - Provide links to more comprehensive analysis

4. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - Add reaction buttons to comments for user feedback
   - Track which insights users find valuable
   - Use feedback to improve future analysis

### 5. CLI Commands for CI Integration

We'll add new CLI commands to support CI integration:

1. **CI Command**: `arc ci` with subcommands:
   - `arc ci analyze`: Analyze a PR and generate a report
     - Options for output format, severity threshold, and analysis depth
     - Support for machine-readable output formats (JSON, YAML)
   - `arc ci comment`: Post a comment to a PR
     - Options for comment mode (create/update), threshold, and format
   - `arc ci refresh`: CI-optimized refresh command
     - Parallel processing of multiple data sources
     - Enhanced progress reporting for CI environments

2. **Configuration Options**:
   - Support for custom configuration files
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Command-line options for CI-specific settings
   - Auto-detection of CI environments

3. **Progress Reporting**:
   - Structured JSON output for machine consumption
   - Detailed progress indicators for CI logs
   - Timestamped entries for performance tracking
   - Support for GitHub Actions annotations and workflow commands
   - Configurable verbosity levels for different CI environments

## Plugin Architecture Extensions

Building on Arc Memory's existing plugin architecture, we'll add CI-specific plugins:

```python
class CIPlugin(Protocol):
    def get_name(self) -> str: ...
    def get_supported_ci_systems(self) -> List[str]: ...
    def process_ci_event(self, event_type: str, payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> None: ...

class BlastRadiusPlugin(Protocol):
    def get_name(self) -> str: ...
    def analyze_changes(self, changes: List[str], depth: int = 2) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
    def get_impact_score(self, changes: List[str]) -> float: ...

class ReportingPlugin(Protocol):
    def get_name(self) -> str: ...
    def format_report(self, analysis_results: Dict[str, Any], format: str = "markdown") -> str: ...
    def should_report(self, impact_score: float, threshold: str = "medium") -> bool: ...
```

This allows for extensibility to different CI systems beyond GitHub Actions and customization of analysis and reporting.
