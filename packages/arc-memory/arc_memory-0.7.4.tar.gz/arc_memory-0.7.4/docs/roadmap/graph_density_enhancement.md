# Graph Density Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to enhance the density and quality of Arc Memory's knowledge graph by integrating more powerful language models and implementing advanced graph construction techniques.

## Current Limitations

1. **Ollama Dependency**: Current LLM enhancement relies on Ollama, which may not provide the depth of analysis needed for high-value insights.
2. **Limited Relationship Extraction**: The current approach may miss implicit relationships and causal connections.
3. **Inconsistent Graph Density**: Graph quality varies based on repository structure and documentation quality.
4. **Performance Constraints**: Deep analysis can be slow, limiting adoption in CI environments.

## Enhancement Strategy

### 1. Multi-Provider LLM Integration

#### 1.1 OpenAI Integration

- **Implementation**: Add direct OpenAI API integration for graph building
  - Create a configurable LLM provider system
  - Support for GPT-4o for highest quality analysis
  - Fallback to GPT-3.5-turbo for cost-sensitive users
  - Implement streaming for long responses

- **Configuration**:
  ```python
  # Example configuration
  arc build --llm-provider openai --llm-model gpt-4o --llm-enhancement
  ```

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Implement batching for efficient API usage
  - Add caching to avoid redundant calls
  - Support for parallel processing

#### 1.2 Anthropic Claude Integration

- **Implementation**: Add Anthropic Claude API integration
  - Support for Claude 3 Opus for highest quality analysis
  - Support for Claude 3 Sonnet for balanced performance/cost
  - Implement context window optimization

- **Configuration**:
  ```python
  # Example configuration
  arc build --llm-provider anthropic --llm-model claude-3-opus-20240229 --llm-enhancement
  ```

#### 1.3 Provider-Agnostic Interface

- **Implementation**: Create a unified interface for LLM providers
  - Abstract provider-specific details
  - Support for authentication management
  - Consistent error handling and retry logic

- **Extension Points**:
  - Plugin system for custom LLM providers
  - Support for self-hosted models
  - Integration with LiteLLM for broader model support

### 2. Advanced Relationship Extraction

#### 2.1 Multi-Stage Analysis Pipeline

- **Implementation**: Create a tiered analysis approach
  - **Stage 1**: Basic structural analysis (fast)
  - **Stage 2**: Semantic analysis of code and comments (medium)
  - **Stage 3**: Deep causal and temporal analysis (thorough)

- **Configuration**:
  ```python
  # Example configuration
  arc build --enhancement-level deep --focus-on-causal
  ```

#### 2.2 Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT)

- **Implementation**: Adapt the KGoT approach for code analysis
  - Break down analysis into multiple reasoning steps
  - Create explicit reasoning nodes in the graph
  - Connect reasoning nodes to code entities

- **Benefits**:
  - More transparent reasoning process
  - Support for multi-hop queries
  - Better explanation of causal relationships

#### 2.3 Temporal Relationship Enhancement

- **Implementation**: Improve temporal modeling
  - Track evolution of entities over time
  - Identify patterns of change
  - Connect changes to external events

- **Query Capabilities**:
  - "How has this component evolved?"
  - "What changes were made in response to issue X?"
  - "When was this pattern introduced and why?"

### 3. Architecture-Specific Schema Annotations

#### 3.1 Schema Extension

- **Implementation**: Add architecture-specific node types and properties
  - Architecture dependency nodes
  - Platform-specific code markers
  - Hardware requirements annotations

- **Example Schema**:
  ```
  Node Type: ArchitectureDependency
  Properties:
    - architecture: ["x86", "ARM", "RISC-V", etc.]
    - dependency_type: ["direct", "indirect", "optional"]
    - migration_difficulty: [1-5 scale]
  ```

#### 3.2 Detection Mechanisms

- **Implementation**: Create detectors for architecture-specific code
  - Pattern-based detection for common architecture dependencies
  - LLM-based analysis for complex cases
  - Integration with existing tools (e.g., compiler flags)

- **Detection Targets**:
  - Architecture-specific libraries
  - Inline assembly
  - Compiler directives
  - Platform-specific optimizations

#### 3.3 Migration Analysis

- **Implementation**: Add migration analysis capabilities
  - Identify potential migration issues
  - Suggest alternative implementations
  - Estimate migration effort

- **Query Capabilities**:
  - "What would be required to migrate this to ARM?"
  - "Which components have architecture-specific dependencies?"
  - "What's the estimated effort to make this cross-platform?"

### 4. Performance Optimization

#### 4.1 Incremental Analysis

- **Implementation**: Optimize for incremental updates
  - Only analyze changed files
  - Preserve existing relationships
  - Update affected subgraphs

- **Configuration**:
  ```python
  # Example configuration
  arc build --incremental --parallel
  ```

#### 4.2 Parallel Processing

- **Implementation**: Add parallel processing support
  - Process independent files concurrently
  - Distribute LLM calls across workers
  - Optimize database operations

- **Performance Target**:
  - 10x speedup for large repositories
  - <5 minutes for incremental builds in CI

#### 4.3 Caching and Memoization

- **Implementation**: Implement intelligent caching
  - Cache LLM responses by content hash
  - Memoize expensive computations
  - Share cache across builds

- **Cache Management**:
  - Automatic cache invalidation
  - Cache size limits
  - Export/import cache for CI environments
