# Arc Memory Launch Readiness Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the critical steps to prepare Arc Memory for beta partner onboarding. It focuses on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that provides immediate value while setting the foundation for continuous improvement based on real-world feedback.

## Strategic Objectives

1. **Enable seamless onboarding and workflow integration**
2. **Deliver unique insights that developers wouldn't otherwise consider**
3. **Support programmatic agent integration for custom workflows**
