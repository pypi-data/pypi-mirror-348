# Arc Memory Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get up and running with Arc Memory in under 30 minutes. We'll cover installation, authentication, building your first knowledge graph, and running basic queries.

## ðŸš€ 5-Minute Setup for the Impatient

Want to get started as quickly as possible? Here's the express setup:

```bash
# Install Arc Memory with all integrations
pip install arc-memory[all]

# Authenticate with GitHub
arc auth github

# Build your knowledge graph
cd /path/to/your/repo
arc build --github --llm-enhancement standard --llm-provider openai --llm-model o4-mini

# Ask a question about your codebase
arc why query "Why was this feature implemented?"
```

That's it! For more detailed instructions and advanced features, continue reading below.

## Step 1: Installation (2 minutes)

Arc Memory requires Python 3.10 or higher.

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install arc-memory

# Or with GitHub and Linear integration
pip install arc-memory[github,linear]

# For LLM enhancement capabilities
pip install arc-memory[llm]

# For all features
pip install arc-memory[all]
```

### One-Line Installation (Alternative)

You can also use our installation script for a streamlined setup:

```bash
curl -sSL https://arc.computer/install.sh | bash

# Or with specific options
curl -sSL https://arc.computer/install.sh | bash -s -- --with-github --with-llm
```

### Installing Ollama (Optional for Enhanced Analysis)

For enhanced natural language queries, you can use Ollama with local models. Install Ollama from [ollama.ai/download](https://ollama.ai/download).

After installing Ollama, start it with:

```bash
ollama serve
```

And pull a model (in a separate terminal):

```bash
ollama pull llama2
```

### Using OpenAI for Enhanced Analysis (Recommended)

For the highest quality analysis, we recommend using OpenAI models:

```bash
# Install with OpenAI support
pip install arc-memory[openai]

# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Build with OpenAI enhancement
arc build --llm-provider openai --llm-model gpt-4o --llm-enhancement
```

## Step 2: Authentication (5 minutes)

### GitHub Authentication

```bash
# Using the CLI (recommended)
arc auth github

# Or programmatically
python -c "from arc_memory.auth.github import authenticate_github; token = authenticate_github(); print(f'Token: {token[:5]}...')"
```

### Linear Authentication (Optional)

```bash
# Using the CLI (recommended)
arc auth linear

# Or programmatically
python -c "from arc_memory.auth.linear import authenticate_linear; token = authenticate_linear(); print(f'Token: {token[:5]}...')"
```

## Step 3: Build Your Knowledge Graph (10 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd /path/to/your/repo

# Build with GitHub data
arc build --github

# Or with both GitHub and Linear data
arc build --github --linear

# For enhanced analysis (takes longer but provides richer insights)
arc build --github --linear --llm-enhancement standard
```

You'll see progress indicators as Arc analyzes your repository and builds the knowledge graph.

### Multi-Repository Support

Arc Memory supports analyzing multiple repositories within a single knowledge graph:

```python
from arc_memory.sdk import Arc

# Initialize with your primary repository
arc = Arc(repo_path="./main-repo")

# Add additional repositories
repo2_id = arc.add_repository("./service-repo", name="Service Repository")
repo3_id = arc.add_repository("./frontend-repo", name="Frontend Repository")

# List all repositories in the knowledge graph
repos = arc.list_repositories()
for repo in repos:
    print(f"{repo['name']} ({repo['id']})")

# Set active repositories for queries
arc.set_active_repositories([repo2_id, repo3_id])

# Query across specific repositories
result = arc.query("How do the frontend and service components interact?")
```

You can also manage repositories using the CLI:

```bash
# Add a repository to the knowledge graph
arc repo add /path/to/another/repo --name "Another Repository"

# List all repositories in the knowledge graph
arc repo list

# Build a specific repository
arc repo build repository:1234abcd

# Set active repositories for queries
arc repo active repository:1234abcd repository:5678efgh

# Run a query across repositories
arc why query "How do the authentication components interact across services?"
```

## Step 4: Run Basic Queries (5 minutes)

### Using the CLI

```bash
# Ask a question about your codebase (requires Ollama to be running)
arc why query "Why was the authentication system refactored?"

# Get the decision trail for a specific file and line
arc why file src/auth/login.py 42

# Find related entities for a commit
arc relate commit abc123
```

### Using the SDK

Create a file named `arc_query.py`:

```python
from arc_memory import Arc

# Initialize Arc with your repository path
arc = Arc(repo_path="./")

# Ask a question about your codebase (requires Ollama to be running)
result = arc.query("Why was the authentication system refactored?")
print(f"Answer: {result.answer}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
print("Evidence:")
for evidence in result.evidence:
    print(f"- {evidence['title']}")

# Get the decision trail for a specific file and line
decision_trail = arc.get_decision_trail("src/auth/login.py", 42)
for entry in decision_trail:
    print(f"\nDecision: {entry.title}")
    print(f"Rationale: {entry.rationale}")
    print(f"Importance: {entry.importance}")

# Find related entities for a commit
related = arc.get_related_entities("commit:abc123")
print("\nRelated entities:")
for entity in related:
    print(f"- {entity.title} ({entity.relationship})")
```

Run it:

```bash
python arc_query.py
```

## Step 5: Framework Integration (8 minutes)

### LangChain Integration

Create a file named `arc_langchain.py`:

```python
from arc_memory import Arc
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize Arc with your repository path
arc = Arc(repo_path="./")

# Get Arc Memory functions as LangChain tools
from arc_memory.sdk.adapters import get_adapter
langchain_adapter = get_adapter("langchain")
tools = langchain_adapter.adapt_functions([
    arc.query,
    arc.get_decision_trail,
    arc.get_related_entities
])

# Create a LangChain agent with Arc Memory tools
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
agent = langchain_adapter.create_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    system_message="You are a helpful assistant with access to Arc Memory."
)

# Use the agent
response = agent.invoke({"input": "What's the decision trail for src/auth/login.py line 42?"})
print(response)
```

Run it:

```bash
python arc_langchain.py
```

### OpenAI Integration

Create a file named `arc_openai.py`:

```python
from arc_memory import Arc

# Initialize Arc with your repository path
arc = Arc(repo_path="./")

# Get Arc Memory functions as OpenAI tools
from arc_memory.sdk.adapters import get_adapter
openai_adapter = get_adapter("openai")
tools = openai_adapter.adapt_functions([
    arc.query,
    arc.get_decision_trail,
    arc.get_related_entities
])

# Create an OpenAI agent with Arc Memory tools
agent = openai_adapter.create_agent(
    tools=tools,
    model="gpt-4o",
    system_message="You are a helpful assistant with access to Arc Memory."
)

# Use the agent
response = agent("What's the decision trail for src/auth/login.py line 42?")
print(response)
```

Run it:

```bash
python arc_openai.py
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Installation Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Command not found: arc"** | Make sure the Python bin directory is in your PATH. Try installing with `pip install --user arc-memory` and check your PATH. |
| **"Python version must be >= 3.10"** | Update your Python version or use a virtual environment with Python 3.10+. |
| **"No module named 'arc_memory'"** | Verify installation with `pip list \| grep arc-memory`. If not listed, reinstall. |
| **"Error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required"** | Install the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). |

### Authentication Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **GitHub authentication fails** | Try manual authentication: `arc auth github --manual` and follow the prompts. |
| **Linear authentication fails** | Verify your Linear API key at [linear.app/settings/api](https://linear.app/settings/api). |
| **"Token not found"** | Run `arc doctor` to check authentication status and follow the suggested fixes. |

### Knowledge Graph Building Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"No such file or directory: '.arc'"** | Make sure you're in a Git repository. Run `git status` to verify. |
| **"Failed to build knowledge graph"** | Check permissions for the `.arc` directory. Try running with `--verbose` for more details. |
| **"LLM enhancement failed"** | For Ollama: ensure Ollama is running with `ollama serve`. For OpenAI: check your API key. |
| **Build process is too slow** | Use `--incremental` for faster builds after the initial one. Try `--parallel` for multi-threading. |

### Query Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"No knowledge graph found"** | Run `arc build` first to create the knowledge graph. |
| **"Failed to connect to Ollama"** | Ensure Ollama is running with `ollama serve` in a separate terminal. |
| **Empty or low-quality responses** | Try building with `--llm-enhancement` for richer analysis or use OpenAI models. |
| **"Entity not found"** | Check entity ID format. For files, use `file:path/to/file.py`. |

### Multi-Repository Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Repository with ID X does not exist"** | Verify the repository ID with `arc repo list`. Make sure you've added the repository with `arc repo add`. |
| **"No results found across repositories"** | Check that you've set active repositories with `arc repo active` or specified repo_ids in your query. |
| **"Repository already exists"** | If you're trying to add the same repository twice, use `arc repo list` to see existing repositories. |
| **"Cross-repository relationships not showing"** | Ensure you've built all repositories and are querying with all relevant repository IDs. |
