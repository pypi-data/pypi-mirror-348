"""
The Array module defines the structure for array management within the TitanQ SDK.

`ArrayBuilder` is an interface that enables its subclasses to construct arrays for use with the TitanQ SDK.

`ArrayLike` is an interface for objects that are considered "array-like." It provides a set of methods that
can be implemented by any classâ€”whether it's a numpy.ndarray or a specialized type (such as scipy's coo_array)
to ensure compatibility with the expected behaviors of the SDK.

`ArrayLike` instances are created through the `ArrayLikeFactory`, ensuring consistency and simplicity across the SDK.

`Array` is an alias for the raw data arrays supported by TitanQ, meaning the array module can directly interact with
these types of arrays.
