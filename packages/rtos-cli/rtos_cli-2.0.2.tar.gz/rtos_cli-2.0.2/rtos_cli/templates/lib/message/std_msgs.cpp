 * @file std_msgs.cpp
 * @brief Implementation file for standard message types.
 *
 * This file is intentionally left empty. Standard message types (e.g., Float32, Int32, Bool, StringMsg)
 * are defined as plain structures in std_msgs.h and do not require any runtime logic.
 *
 * This file exists to support potential future expansions, such as utility functions for serialization,
 * printing, or initialization helpers.
