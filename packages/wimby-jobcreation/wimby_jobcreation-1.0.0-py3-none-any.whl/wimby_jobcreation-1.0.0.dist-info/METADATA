# wimby_jobcreation

**Estimate wind farm job creation across all project stages using publicly available data and models.**

---

## Overview

The `wimby_jobcreation` package provides a model to estimate **job creation** throughout the **lifetime of individual wind farms**. It draws from scientific and grey literature to offer robust, stage-specific employment estimations.

---

## Key Features

- ðŸ”¹ Estimates **direct**, **indirect**, and **induced** job creation.
- ðŸ”¹ Covers **all life stages**: development, construction, manufacturing, operation & maintenance, and decommissioning.
- ðŸ”¹ Calculates **employment factors** in **job-years per megawatt (job-years/MW)** for individual wind farms.

---

## Installation

Install the latest version from PyPI:

```bash
pip install wimby_jobcreation
```

---

## Usage

```python
import wimby_jobcreation as wjc

# Example usage
turbine_capacity = 3  # Capacity in MW
onshore_offshore = 'Onshore'  # Type of wind farm
statistics = wjc.calculate_job_creation_statistics(jobcreation_review_data.csv)  # Load model statistics
country = 'UK'  # Country context
number_of_turbines = 5  # Number of turbines

# Calculate employment factors
results = wjc.calculate_employment_factors_with_regression(
    turbine_capacity, 
    onshore_offshore, 
    statistics, 
    country, 
    number_of_turbines
)

print(results)
```

We welcome contributions! Please fork the repository and submit pull requests, or open an issue to report bugs and suggest features.
We are also looking to grow the underlying data base: jobcreation_review_data.csv if you are interested to contribute please have a look of https://wimby.eu/resource/d2-9-data-on-regulatory-and-socio-economic-conditions-and-impacts-a/ to see how that data was gathered.
