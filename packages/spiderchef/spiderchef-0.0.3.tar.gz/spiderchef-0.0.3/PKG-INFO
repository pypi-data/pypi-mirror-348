SpiderChef is a powerful, recipe-based web scraping tool that makes data extraction systematic and reproducible. By defining scraping procedures as "recipes" with sequential "steps," SpiderChef allows you to craft elegant, maintainable data extraction workflows.

## Features

- Recipe-Based Architecture: Define extraction workflows as YAML recipes
- Modular Step System: Build complex scraping logic from reusable components
- Async Support: Handle both synchronous and asynchronous extraction steps
- Type Safety: Fully typed for better development experience
- Extensible Design: Easily create custom steps for specialized extraction needs

## Installation

```bash
# If you want to use the cli
pip install spiderchef[cli]

# If you just want the library usage
pip install spiderchef
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Run a recipe
spiderchef cook recipes/example.yaml

# Create a new recipe template
spiderchef recipe new my_extraction
```


## Library Usage

### Basic Usage
The basic usage of this library involves just pulling a local recipe and "cooking" it to get the output data:
```python
import asyncio
from spiderchef import Recipe

# Imports a recipe from a yaml file locally
recipe = Recipe.from_yaml('recipe_example.yaml')
# Run a recipe
asyncio.run(recipe.cook())
```

### Custom Usage
Let's say you want to extend the steps available even more with your own custom ones, you can do it like so:
```python
import asyncio
from typing import Any

from spiderchef import STEP_REGISTRY, AsyncStep, Recipe, SyncStep


# You can define your own custom steps like so:
class HelloStep(SyncStep):
    # .name is a reserved keyword for steps
    person_name: str

    def _execute(self, recipe: Recipe, previous_output: Any = None) -> str:
        return f"Hello There {self.person_name}"


# Sync or Async is possible.
class SleepStep(AsyncStep):
    sleep_time: int = 5

    async def _execute(self, recipe: Recipe, previous_output: Any = None) -> Any:
        await asyncio.sleep(self.sleep_time)
        return previous_output


CUSTOM_STEP_REGISTRY = {**STEP_REGISTRY, "hello": HelloStep, "sleep": SleepStep}

# Overrides the global step registry with your own
Recipe.step_registry = CUSTOM_STEP_REGISTRY

# You can manually initiziales a recipe like so, or just use the yaml recipe.
recipe = Recipe(
    base_url="https://example.com",
    name="Example",
    steps=[
        HelloStep(name="Saying Hello", person_name="George"),
        SleepStep(
            name="Sleeping",
        ),
    ],
)

# Run a recipe
asyncio.run(recipe.cook())

"""Output:
2025-05-07 16:33:01 [info     ] 🥣🥄🔥 Cooking 'Example' recipe!
2025-05-07 16:33:01 [info     ] ➡️  1. Saying Hello...         step_class=HelloStep
2025-05-07 16:33:01 [info     ] ➡️  2. Sleeping...             step_class=SleepStep
2025-05-07 16:33:06 [info     ] 🍞 'Example' recipe finished output='Hello There George'
"""
```

## Example Recipe

```yaml
base_url: https://example.com
name: ProductExtractor
steps:
  - type: fetch
    name: fetch_product_page
    page_type: text
    path: /products
    params:
      category: electronics
      sort: price_asc
  
  - type: regex
    name: extract_product_urls
    expression: '"(\/product\/[^"]+)"'
  
  - type: join_base_url
    name: format_urls
```

## Why SpiderChef?
Traditional web scraping often involves writing complex, difficult-to-maintain code that mixes HTTP requests, parsing, and business logic. SpiderChef separates these concerns by:

- Breaking extraction into discrete, reusable steps
- Defining workflows as declarative recipes
- Handling common extraction patterns with built-in steps
- Making scraping procedures reproducible and maintainable

Whether you're scraping product data, monitoring prices, or extracting research information, SpiderChef helps you build structured, reliable data extraction pipelines.
