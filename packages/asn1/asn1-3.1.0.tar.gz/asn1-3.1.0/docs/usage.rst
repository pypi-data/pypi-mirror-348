Usage
=====

.. note::

   You can find a complete example in `examples`.


The Python-ASN1 API is exposed by a single Python module named
`asn1`. The main interface is provided by the following classes:

* `Encoder`: Used to encode ASN.1.
* `Decoder`: Used to decode ASN.1.
* `Error`: Exception used to signal errors.

Type Mapping
------------

The Python-ASN1 encoder and decoder make a difference between primitive and
constructed data types. Primitive data types can be encoded and decoded
directly with `read()` and `write()` methods.  For these types, ASN.1 types are
mapped directly to Python types and vice versa, as per the table below:

================ ========== =========== =============
ASN.1 type       Tag Number Decoding    Encoding
================ ========== =========== =============
Boolean          0x01       bool        bool
Integer          0x02       int         int
Null             0x05       None        None
ObjectIdentifier 0x06       str
Real             0x09       float       float
Enumerated       0x0A       int
================ ========== =========== =============

Because ASN.1 has more data types than Python, the situation arises that one Python
type corresponds to multiple ASN.1 types. In this situation, the to be encoded
ASN.1 type cannot be determined from the Python type. The solution
implemented in Python-ASN1 is that the most frequently used type will be the
implicit default. This is indicated in the ``Encoding`` column.
If another type is desired than that must be specified
explicitly through the API.

Some ASN.1 types can be either primitive or constructed. They can be encoded
and decoded like primitive types. The following table shows the mapping between
ASN.1 types and Python types.

================ ========== =========== =============
ASN.1 type       Tag Number Decoding    Encoding
================ ========== =========== =============
BitString        0x03       bytes
OctetString      0x04       bytes       bytes
UTF8String       0x0C       str
NumericString    0x12       str
PrintableString  0x13       str         str
T61String        0x14       str
VideotextString  0x15       str
IA5String        0x16       str
GraphicString    0x19       str
VisibleString    0x1A       str
GeneralString    0x1B       str
UniversalString  0x1C       str
CharacterString  0x1D       str
UnicodeString    0x1E       str
================ ========== =========== =============

For constructed types, there are two possibilities. The first is to treat them
as a sequence of types. In this case, the encoder and decoder will automatically
map the ASN.1 types to Python types and vice versa.

================ ========== =========== =============
ASN.1 type       Tag Number Decoding    Encoding
================ ========== =========== =============
Sequence         0x10       list        list
Set              0x11       list
================ ========== =========== =============

The second possibility is to treat them as a stack of types. In this approach,
the user needs to explicitly enter/leave the constructed type using the
`Encoder.enter()` and `Encoder.leave()` methods of the encoder and the
`Decoder.enter()` and `Decoder.leave()` methods of the decoder.

Encoding
--------

If you want to encode data and retrieve its DER-encoded representation, use code such as:

.. code-block:: python

  import asn1

  encoder = asn1.Encoder()
  encoder.start()
  encoder.write('1.2.3', asn1.Numbers.ObjectIdentifier)
  encoded_bytes = encoder.output()

It is also possible to encode data directly to a file or any stream:

.. code-block:: python

  import asn1

  with open('output.der', 'wb') as f:
    encoder = asn1.Encoder()
    encoder.start(f)
    encoder.write('1.2.3', asn1.Numbers.ObjectIdentifier)

You can encode complex data structures such as sequences and sets:

.. code-block:: python

  import asn1

  with open('output.der', 'wb') as f:
        encoder = asn1.Encoder()
        encoder.start(f)
        encoder.write(['test1', 'test2', [
            1,
            0.125,
            b'\x01\x02\x03'
        ]])

ASN.1 types are automatically mapped to Python types.
If you want to precisely specify the ASN.1 type, you have to use the `Encoder.enter()` and `Encoder.leave()` methods:

.. code-block:: python

  import asn1

  with open('output.der', 'wb') as f:
        encoder = asn1.Encoder()
        encoder.start(f)
        encoder.enter(asn1.Numbers.Sequence)
        encoder.write('test1', asn1.Numbers.PrintableString)
        encoder.write('test2', asn1.Numbers.PrintableString)
        encoder.enter(asn1.Numbers.Sequence)
        encoder.write(1, asn1.Numbers.Integer)
        encoder.write(0.125, asn1.Numbers.Real)
        encoder.write(b'\x01\x02\x03', asn1.Numbers.OctetString)
        encoder.leave()
        encoder.leave()

This also allows to encode data progressively, without having to keep everything in memory.

DER and CER
-----------

The encoder uses DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding by default. If you want to use CER (Canonical Encoding Rules) encoding,
you can do so by calling the `Encoder.start()` method with a stream as argument:

.. code-block:: python

        stream = open('output.cer', 'wb')
        encoder = asn1.Encoder()
        encoder.start(stream)

You can explicitly specify the CER encoding without using a stream:

.. code-block:: python

        encoder = asn1.Encoder()
        encoder.start(Encoder.CER)

You can explicitly specify the DER encoding when using a stream:

.. code-block:: python

        stream = open('output.cer', 'wb')
        encoder = asn1.Encoder()
        encoder.start(stream, Encoder.DER)

DER has the advantage to be predicatable: there is one and only one way to encode a message using DER. DER is
commonly used in security-related applications such as X.509 digital certificates. DER uses definite lengths for all
encoded messages. This means that the length of the encoded message is known in advance. This is useful for encoding
messages that are fixed in size or that do not change in size over time. The disadvantage of DER is that the encoded
binary data are kept in memory until the encoding is finished. This can be a problem for very large messages.

CER is similar to DER, but it uses indefinite lengths. This means that the length of the encoded message is not
known in advance. This is useful for encoding messages that may be very large or that may change in size over time.
The advantage of CER is that the encoded binary data are not kept in memory until the encoding is finished. This
means that the encoder can start writing the encoded message to a file or a stream as soon as it is available.

IMPORTANT: There was a mistake in version 3.0.0 of Python-ASN1 where the encoder used CER encoding by default contrary to the
previous versions that were using DER. This was fixed in version 3.0.1: CER is the default encoding when using a stream.
Otherwise, DER is the default encoding.

Decoding
--------

If you want to decode ASN.1 from BER (DER, CER, ...) encoded bytes, use code such as:

.. code-block:: python

  import asn1

  decoder = asn1.Decoder()
  decoder.start(encoded_bytes)
  tag, value = decoder.read()

It is also possible to decode data directly from a file or any stream:

.. code-block:: python

  import asn1

  with open('input.der', 'rb') as f:
    decoder = asn1.Decoder()
    decoder.start(f)
    tag, value = decoder.read()

You can decode complex data structures. The decoder will automatically map ASN.1 types to Python types:

.. code-block:: python

    import asn1

    with open('example7.der', 'rb') as f:
        decoder = asn1.Decoder()
        decoder.start(f)
        tag, value = decoder.read()
        print(tag)
        pprint.pprint(value)

You can ask the decoder to return the number of unused bits when decoding a BitString:

.. code-block:: python

    import asn1

    encoded = b'\x23\x0C\x03\x02\x00\x0B\x03\x02\x00\x0B\x03\x02\x04\x0F'
    decoder = asn1.Decoder()
    decoder.start(encoded)
    tag, (value, unused) = decoder.read(asn1.ReadFlags.WithUnused)
    print('Tag: ', tag)
    print('Value: ', value)
    print('Unused bits: ', unused)

The flag ``ReadFlags.WithUnused`` can be used with any ASN.1 type. When used, the read method will return a tuple with the value and the number of unused bits.
If the type is not a BitString, the number of unused bits is always 0.


Constants
---------

A few constants are defined in the `asn1` module. The
constants immediately below correspond to ASN.1 tag numbers.
They can be used as the ``nr`` parameter of the
`Encoder.write()` method, and are returned as the
first part of a ``(nr, typ, cls)`` tuple as returned by
`Decoder.peek()` and
`Decoder.read()`.
