========
Overview
========

Python-ASN1 is a simple ASN.1 encoder and decoder for Python 2.7 and 3.5+.

Features
========

- Support BER (parser) and DER (parser and generator) encoding (including indefinite lengths)
- 100% python, compatible with version 2.7, 3.5 and higher
- Can be integrated by just including a file into your project
- Support most common ASN.1 types including REAL (encoding and decoding).

Dependencies
==============

Python-ASN1 relies on `Python-Future <https://python-future.org>`_ for Python 2 and 3 compatibility. To install Python-Future:

.. code-block:: sh

  pip install future

Python-ASN1 relies on `type hints <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_. For Python 2.7, a backport of the standard library typing module has to be installed:

.. code-block:: sh

  pip install typing

This is not necessary for Python 3.5 and higher since it is part of the standard library.

How to install Python-asn1
==========================

Install from PyPi with the following:

.. code-block:: sh

  pip install asn1

or download the repository from `GitHub <https://github.com/andrivet/python-asn1>`_ and install with the following:

.. code-block:: sh

  python setup.py install

You can also simply include ``asn1.py`` into your project.


How to use Python-asn1
======================

.. note:: You can find more detailed documentation on the `Usage`_ page.

.. _Usage: usage.rst

Encoding
--------

If you want to encode data and retrieve its DER-encoded representation, use code such as:

.. code-block:: python

  import asn1

  encoder = asn1.Encoder()
  encoder.start()
  encoder.write('1.2.3', asn1.Numbers.ObjectIdentifier)
  encoded_bytes = encoder.output()


Decoding
--------

If you want to decode ASN.1 from DER or BER encoded bytes, use code such as:

.. code-block:: python

  import asn1

  decoder = asn1.Decoder()
  decoder.start(encoded_bytes)
  tag, value = decoder.read()


Documentation
=============
