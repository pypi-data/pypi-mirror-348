# Buffalo
Buffalo is a fast and scalable production-ready open source project for recommender systems. Buffalo effectively utilizes system resources, enabling high performance even on low-spec machines. The implementation is optimized for CPU and SSD. Even so, it shows good performance with GPU accelerator, too. Buffalo, developed by Kakao, has been reliably used in production for various Kakao services.
