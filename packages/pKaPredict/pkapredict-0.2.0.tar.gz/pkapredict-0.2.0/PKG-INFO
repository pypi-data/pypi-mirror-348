## 📦 Overview

*pKaPredict* is a cheminformatics tool that predicts the acid dissociation constant (pKa) of chemical compounds from their SMILES strings.  The package is designed to be easily pip-installable and modular, making it ideal for cheminformatics applications. The package combines RDKit generated molecular descriptors with a pre-trained LGBMRegressor model for fast, reproducible predictions. The workflow includes training data preprocessing, descriptor generation, model loading, prediction, and result visualization.

💡 Main Functions :

*Functions used to train the machine learning model on a training dataset*

→ **download_raw_dataset**
Downloads a CSV file from a given URL and saves it in the specific data directory.

→ **preview_data**
Loads and previews the raw pKa dataset from a relative file path.

→ **clean_and_visualize_pka**
Cleans the training dataset by removing duplicates and missing values; also provides basic visualizations for data exploration.

→ **RDKit_descriptors**
Transforms a DataFrame of SMILES into molecular descriptors, used for training the model.
    
→ **plot_data**
Creates scatter plots comparing predicted vs. experimental pKa values to evaluate model performance and choose the most adapted model for this usage.

→ **plot_k_vs_r2_ET and LGBMplot_k_vs_r2**
Plots R² scores versus number of selected features (k) and saves the plot for the two machine learning models tested.

*Core functions for predicting pKa from user-provided SMILES inputs*

→ **load_model**
Loads the pre-trained LightGBM model optimized for pKa prediction.

→ **smiles_to_rdkit_descriptors**
Converts a user-provided SMILES input into a vector of RDKit molecular descriptors.

→ **predict_pKa**
Takes molecular descriptors as input and returns predicted pKa values using the loaded model.


## 👩‍💻 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anastasiafloris/pKaPredict.git
cd pKaPredict
```
2. **Create and activate the conda environnement**:
```bash
conda create -n pkapredict_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate pkapredict_env
```
3. **Install the package**:
```bash 
pip install pKaPredict
```

🍏 For macOS users (⚠ required for LightGBM to work):

4. **Install the system library libomp**:
```bash
brew install libomp
```
If brew is not installed, follow the instructions here: https://brew.sh

5. **Navigate to the script folder of the package in your terminal**:
```bash
cd script
```
6. **The package is yours 🎁**:

Run the runpackage.py file in your terminal to predict the pKa of a molecule of your choice, using its SMILES string:
```bash
python runpackage.py
```
