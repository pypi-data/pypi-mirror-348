# Laser Learning Environment
The Laser Learning Environment (LLE) is a multi-agent gridworld aimed for
research in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. The main dynamic of LLE revolves around lasers since walking in a laser is deadly for all agents except those of the same colour as the laser. When an agent of the same colour as the laser walks in a laser, the laser is blocked and other agents can safely walk through it.

LLE has diﬀerent types of tiles: floor, start, wall, laser, laser source, void, gem, and exit tiles, as illustrated in the below image.

## General-purpose `World`
The `World` class is at the heart of LLE and is meant for fine-grained control of the environment, as opposed to the `LLE` class, meant for generic high-level control in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

```python
from lle import World, Action

# A map with one agent, one gem and one exit.
world = World("S0 . G X")
world.reset()
state = world.get_state()
world.step([Action.EAST])
world.set_state(state)
```

## Cooperative MARL `LLE`
The `LLE` class is meant for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Leanring (MARL) and to be used with the `multi-agent-rlenv` library. As such, it encapsulates the `World` class and provides a high-level API for multi-agent reinforcement learning. `LLE` can be used with either in single-objective or multi-objective mode as shown below.

```python
from lle import LLE

env = LLE.level(6).obs_type("layered").build()
obs = env.reset()
action = env.sample_action()
env.step(action)
```

## Creating custom maps
You can create custom maps in two ways: using a plain string or a TOML file.

### Plain string
In this very simple text-based syntax, every tile is encoded by one or by a few characters (see the encoding in the below table), and tiles are separated by whitespaces. A new row is indicated by a new line.

| Character | Tile | Walkable | Comment |
------------|------|----------|---------|
| `.` | Floor | Yes | The most basic tile. |
| `@` | Wall  | No | A wall that blocks lasers. |
| `X` | Exit  | Yes | An exit tile. The agent can no longer move after reaching it. |
| `G` | Gem   | Yes | A gem to collect. |
| `S<n>` | Start | Yes | Start position of agent `n`. |
| `L<n><d>` | Laser source | No | Source of a laser of colour `n` (a number) beaming toward the direction `d` (N, S, E, W). |
| `V` | Void | Yes | A void tile. The agent dies if it walks on it |

For instance, assuming that a file "map.txt" has the following content
```
 S0 . G . X
 S1 @ . . .
L0E . . V V
 @  @ . V V
 G  . . . X
```
Then, the below code sample generates the world shown below.
```python
with open("map.txt") as f:
  str_map = f.read()
# Alternative: World.from_file("map.txt")
world = World(str_map)
img = world.get_image()
plt.imshow(img)
plt.show()
```

### Toml syntax
You can also use TOML files to define maps, which enables more complex maps, for instance with random start positions. The below TOML file shows an example of a map with random start positions.

Positions can be specified as a list of positions `{i, j}` and rectangles `{i_min, i_max, j_min, j_max}`, and the `world_string` field can be used to define the map as discussed in the "Plain string" section.

```toml
width = 10 # Optional, deduced from `world_string`
height = 5 # Optional, deduced from `world_string`
exits = [{ j_min = 9 }]
gems = [{ i = 0, j = 2 }]
starts = [{ row = 2}] # All tiles on row=2 are start positions for all agents
world_string = '''
X . . . S1 . . . . .
. . . . .  . . . . .
. . . . .  . . . . .
. . . . .  . . . . .
. . . . S2 . . . . .
'''

[[agents]]
# Define a rectangle of possible start positions with both ends included.
# The default minimal value is 0.
# The default maximal value is the width (for j) or height (for i) of the map.
starts = [{ i_min = 0, i_max = 2 }] # Rectangle from (0, 0) to (2, 4) included

[[agents]]
# Deduced from the string map that agent 1 has a start position at (0, 5).

[[agents]]
# Can either start on the 2nd row or on the 7th column.
starts = [{ row = 2 }, { col = 7 }]

[[agents]]
# Start positions can be a mix of rectangles, rows, columns and positions.
starts = [
    { i = 4, j = 9 },
    { i_min = 1, i_max = 3, j_min = 0, j_max = 3 },
    { j_min = 4 },
]
```

## Citing our work
The environment has been presented at [EWRL 2023](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=IPfdjr4rIs) and at [BNAIC 2023](https://bnaic2023.tudelft.nl/static/media/BNAICBENELEARN_2023_paper_124.c9f5d29e757e5ee27c44.pdf) where it received the best paper award.
