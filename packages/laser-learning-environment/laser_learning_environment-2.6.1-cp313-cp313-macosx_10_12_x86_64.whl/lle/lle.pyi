    To inherit from `WorldState`, it is required to override the `__new__` method such that you its signature
    is compatible with `__init__`, i.e. it accepts the same leading arguments in the same order.
    Additionally, the `__new__` method **must** call the `super()` constructor with the parameters of the parent class, as shown below.
