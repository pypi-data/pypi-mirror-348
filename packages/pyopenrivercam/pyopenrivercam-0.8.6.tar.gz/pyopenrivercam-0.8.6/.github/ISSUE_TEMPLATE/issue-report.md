First of all, thank you for taking the time to report an issue.

Before you provide an issue, kindly first look at the following questions:
- Did anyone else already submitted an issue that seems to be the same?
- In case the issue relates to a particular video that seems not to work, is the video also unplayable in a normal video player like VLC? If not, we cannot treat your issue.

If none of the above questions above can be answered with "Yes", then please answer the questions below and remove this instruction. If you don't know how to answer a question, then please also write so.
