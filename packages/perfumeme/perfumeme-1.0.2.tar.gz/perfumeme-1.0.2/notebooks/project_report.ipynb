    "## Introduction\n",
    "Perfumes are a part of our everyday lives‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a subtle floral hint or a bold, spicy statement, most people have a signature scent that others come to recognize them by. But have you ever wondered what‚Äôs actually in your favorite fragrance? Perfumes are complex mixtures of countless molecules, and each one plays a unique role in shaping the scent you love.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can you figure out which molecule is responsible for that special note in your perfume? And once you have a molecule in mind, how do you know if it‚Äôs safe, aromatic, or even used in other fragrances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Meet __PERFUMEme.py__, ‚Äî a Python package that helps demystify the chemistry behind your scent. Simply input a molecule, and the tool will tell you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether the molecule is fragrant or toxic\n",
    "- Its key physical properties, such as boiling point\n",
    "- How it evaporates over time, via an evaporation model\n",
    "- And best of all, which perfumes (when data allows) contain that exact molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlock the secrets behind the scents ‚Äî one molecule at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main chemistry involved is organic chemistry and physical chemistry, particularly focusing on volatility and evaporation.\n"

    "## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The __PERFUMEme__ project is a Python-based toolkit designed to bridge the gap between perfumery and cheminformatics by enabling structured, molecule-level exploration of commercial fragrances. Its primary function is to understand if a certain molecule is usable in the perfume industry and understand why or why not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfumes are typically described by their olfactory notes (e.g., floral, woody, spicy) and ingredient names, but rarely include explicit chemical representations. This lack of molecular data limits the potential for computational analysis and machine learning applications in fragrance design. PERFUMEme addresses this issue by enabling users to convert perfume data‚Äîincluding name, brand, ingredient names, and scent notes‚Äîinto a format enriched with chemical identifiers, suitable for further computational analysis, clustering, or visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package processes structured JSON input and performs the following key tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Queries PubChem using molecule names to retrieve SMILES strings\n",
    "- Handles ambiguous or unrecognized molecule names with graceful fallbacks.\n",
    "- Returns structured data that can be visualized and analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining publicly available molecular data with perfume metadata, PERFUMEme provides a foundation for exploring relationships between molecular composition and fragrance perception, opening the door to computational fragrance classification, similarity scoring, and even automated formulation tools. The typical user of this package would be fragrance chemists, cosmetic scientists, cheminformatics researchers, or curious enthusiasts with a background in organic or physical chemistry ‚Äî especially those interested in functional groups and molecular volatility. \n",
    "\n",
    "_This may be a bit too repetitive._"

    "### üóÇ Data Sources\n",
    "Molecular data were retrieved from PubChem, a publicly accessible chemical database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The PubChem PUG REST API was used to access compound properties, such as their molecular names, SMILES strings, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporisation and pressure value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fragrance data, including perfume names, brands, notes, and associated molecules, were compiled manually and stored in a local JSON file. This file served as the data set for the perfume_molecule.py functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ùå§ Package Structure\n",
    "The __PERFUMEme__ package was implemented in Python and organized into several functional modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- scraper.py: includes functions used to add the molecules listed in the perfumes in perfume.json to a new database and on to addtheir smiles from PubChem, used withodors.csv to add their respective odors (if they had smell).\n",
    "- utils.py: contains utility functions for validating molecule data, handling API errors, and processing JSON inputs.\n",
    "- data/: directory containing the JSON files with structured perfume and molecular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package was developed to be modular, allowing users to integrate new data sources or extend the current capabilities without modifying core functions. For example, adding a molecule with its odor and SMILES to molecules.json."
