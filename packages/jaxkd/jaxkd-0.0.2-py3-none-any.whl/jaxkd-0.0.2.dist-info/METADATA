# JAX *k*-D
Find *k*-nearest neighbors using a *k*-d tree in JAX!

This is an XLA version of two GPU-friendly tree algorithms [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00120), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12859)]. It is convenient and lightweight, but the original CUDA implementation [[3](https://github.com/ingowald/cudaKDTree)] may be a better choice depending on the application.

The `build_tree`, `query_neighbors`, and `count_neighbors` operations are compatible with JIT and automatic differentiation. They are reasonably fast when vectorized on GPU, but will be much slower than `scipy.spatial.KDTree` on CPU. The main advantage is to avoid the complexity of using non-JAX libraries and potentially leaving JIT and the GPU when a scalable nearest neighbor search is needed as part of a larger JAX program.

## Usage

```python
import jax
import jaxkd as jk

kp, kq = jax.random.split(jax.random.key(83))
points = jax.random.normal(kp, shape=(100_000, 3))
queries = jax.random.normal(kq, shape=(10_000, 3))

tree = jk.build_tree(points)
neighbors, distances = jk.query_neighbors(tree, queries, 10)
counts = jk.count_neighbors(tree, queries, 0.1)
```

There is also a simple k-means implementation in `jaxkd.extras`. More suggestions welcome!

## Installation
To install, use `pip`. The only dependency is `jax`.
```
python -m pip install jaxkd
```
Or just grab `tree.py`.

## Notes
- The `demo.ipynb` notebook in the source repository has some additional examples, including gradient-based optimization using neighbors and iterative clustering with $k$-means.
- The `query_neighbors` function is intended for small values of *k* and does not use a max heap for simplicity.
- Some common *k*-d tree operations such as ball search are not implemented because they do not return a fixed size array. But there are probably others which could be implemented if there is a need. Suggestions welcome!
- Only the Euclidean distance is currently supported, this relatively easy to change if needed.
