        According to Coccolo et al. (2016), the Wind Chill Temperature (WCT)
        considers the cooling power of wind by taking into account the wind 
        speed at a height of 10 m (m.s-1). It can be applied to analyze the 
        thermal comfort in a cold environment (Coccolo et al., 2016)
