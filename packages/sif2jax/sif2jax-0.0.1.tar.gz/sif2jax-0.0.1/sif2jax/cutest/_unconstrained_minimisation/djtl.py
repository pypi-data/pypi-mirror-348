    """DJTL optimization problem.

    This is a 2-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem derived from
    a modification of problem 19 in the Hock and Schittkowski collection.
    It is meant to simulate a Lagrangian barrier objective function
    for particular values of shifts and multipliers.

    The problem includes cubic and quadratic terms with logarithmic barrier functions,
    making it a challenging optimization problem.
