This module is intended to be imported into any script requiring a simple HTTP status reporting page.
This optionally supports threading as well, defining the ``run_threaded`` and ``make_thread`` methods.

## Setup

This module can be installed using:

``pip install simplestatusserver``

## Module Interface

This module only contains a single (fully documented) class: ``SimpleStatusServer``.
This cass can be instantiated to generate and when desired, run, a simple HTTP server.
This server will report the data contained within that instance's ``status`` attribute as json.
The instance itself may also be used as a dictionary, passing along all the data contained withing its ``status``
If the ``threading`` module is imported (which can be checked using the module's ``STATUS_SERVER_THREADING_POSSIBLE`` constant), threading related running methods are also defined for this class.
Refer to the docstrings for each method for more information.
This module contains type hints.

### Example

```python:
from simplestatusserver import SimpleStatusServer, STATUS_SERVER_THREADING_POSSIBLE as THREADING_POSSIBLE
#Note: this example presumes that the threading module is available!
assert THREADING_POSSIBLE, "The threading module must be available for this example to work!"

#some code here...

server = SimpleStatusServer(init_status = {"hello": "world"})
server["world"] == "hello" #returns True
server["status"] = "starting..."
#now run the http server
server.run_threaded(debug = True)

#perhaps a startup routine here?

server["status"] = "running"
del server["world"] #lets remove this key...

try:
  #the main part of a script here...
  pass
except Exception as e:
  server["error"] = str(e)
  server["error code"] = 1

#finish off things here...

print("all done!")

```
