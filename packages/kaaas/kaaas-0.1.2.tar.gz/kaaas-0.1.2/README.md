KAAS - Kubernetes AI-powered Cluster Analysis and Solution
KAAS is a tool that leverages AI to analyze Kubernetes clusters, identify issues, and provide solutions using tools like k8sgpt and LLMs (e.g., Ollama, Bedrock).
Installation

Install KAAS via pip:pip install kaas



Configuration

sns_topic_arn: SNS Topic ARN for notifications.
log_group and log_stream: CloudWatch Log Group and Stream names.
pricing_url: URL for multi-cluster pricing information.

To find the installed config.yaml:
python -c "import kaas; print(kaas.__path__[0])"

Then edit config.yaml in that directory, or create a config.yaml in your working directory to override the defaults.
