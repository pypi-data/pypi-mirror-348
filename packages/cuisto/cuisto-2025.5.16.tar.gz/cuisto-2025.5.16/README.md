Python package for histological quantification of objects in reference atlas regions.

`cuisto` uses data exported from [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io) used with [ABBA](https://abba-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to pool data and derive, average and display metrics.

## Install
Steps 1-3 below need to be performed only once. If Anaconda or conda is already installed, skip steps 1-2 and use the Anaconda prompt instead.
1. Install [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/), as user, add conda to PATH and make it the default interpreter.
2. Open a terminal (PowerShell in Windows). run : `conda init` and restart the terminal.
3. Create a virtual environment named "cuisto-env" with Python 3.12 :
    ```bash
    conda create -n cuisto-env python=3.12
    ```
4. Activate the environment :
    ```bash
    conda activate cuisto-env
    ```
5. Install `cuisto` :
    ```bash
    pip install cuisto
    ```
6. (Optional) Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/TeamNCMC/cuisto/releases/latest) (choose "Source code (zip)) and unzip it on your computer. You can copy the `scripts/` folder to get access to the QuPath and Python scripts. You can check the notebooks in `docs/demo_notebooks` as well !

The `cuisto` package will be then available in Python from anywhere as long as the `cuisto-env` conda environment is activated. You can get started by looking and using the [Jupyter notebooks](#using-notebooks).

For more complete installation instructions, see the [documentation](https://teamncmc.github.io/cuisto/main-getting-started.html#slow-start).

## Update
To update, simply activate your environment (`conda activate cuisto-env`) and run :
```bash
pip install cuisto --upgrade
```

## Using notebooks
Some Jupyter notebooks are available in the "docs/demo_notebooks" folder. You can open them in an IDE (such as [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), select the "cuisto-env" environment as kernel in the top right) or in the Jupyter web interface (`jupyter notebook` in the terminal, with the "cuisto-env" environment activated).

## Brain structures
You can generate brain structures outlines coordinates in three projections (coronal, sagittal, top-view) with the script in scripts/atlas/generate_atlas_outline.py. They are used to overlay brain regions outlines in 2D projection density maps. It might take a while so you can also grab a copy of those files here:
