    """
    Calculates the Commodity Channel Index (CCI), a momentum oscillator used to identify cyclical trends
    and extreme market conditions.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame.
        parameters (dict, optional): Dictionary containing calculation parameters:
            - window (int): The lookback period for the calculation. Default is 20.
            - constant (float): The scaling factor used in the CCI formula. Default is 0.015.
        columns (dict, optional): Dictionary containing column name mappings:
            - high_col (str): The column name for high prices. Default is 'High'.
            - low_col (str): The column name for low prices. Default is 'Low'.
            - close_col (str): The column name for closing prices. Default is 'Close'.

    Returns:
        pd.Series: CCI values for the given input series.

    The CCI is calculated in three steps:

    1. Calculate the Typical Price (TP):
       TP = (High + Low + Close) / 3

    2. Calculate the Simple Moving Average of the Typical Price (SMA(TP)):
       SMA(TP) = n-period SMA of TP

    3. Calculate the Mean Deviation (MD):
       MD = Mean of absolute deviations of TP from SMA(TP)

    4. Calculate the CCI:
       CCI = (TP - SMA(TP)) / (constant * MD)

    The constant (0.015) is used to normalize the CCI to make it comparable across different securities.
    
    Use Cases:

    - Identifying overbought/oversold conditions: Values above +100 suggest overbought conditions,
      while values below -100 suggest oversold conditions.
    - Detecting trend strength: Values consistently above +100 indicate a strong uptrend, while
      values consistently below -100 indicate a strong downtrend.
    - Identifying potential reversals: Divergence between CCI and price can signal potential reversals.
    - Generating trading signals: Crossing above/below zero line or +/-100 thresholds can generate signals.
