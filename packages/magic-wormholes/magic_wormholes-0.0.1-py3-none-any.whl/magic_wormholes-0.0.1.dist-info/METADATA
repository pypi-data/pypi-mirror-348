# magic-wormholes

You've taken a wrong turn. You are probably looking for
'[magic-wormhole](https://pypi.org/project/magic-wormhole/)', without the trailing 's'.

I wanted to play around with magic-wormhole, and accidentally tried to install `magic-wormholes`.
To make sure noone squats the name maliciously, I'll squat the name non-maliciously.

Dear PyPI, please ban this package. Noone should be allowed to squat this name at all.
