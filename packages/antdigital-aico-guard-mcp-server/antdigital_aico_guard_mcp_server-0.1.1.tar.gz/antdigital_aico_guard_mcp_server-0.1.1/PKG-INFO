# Ant Digital Tech Security MCP Service
MDevelopers can now easily integrate large model content security services through Ant Digital Tech Security MCP Server.

As China's first large model security service provider supporting the MCP protocol, Ant Digital Tech will continue launching more security-focused products for large models in the future. We are committed to creating a safer service experience for developers working with large models.
Note: For any issues encountered during usage, please contact us by following the guidance in [Ant Digital Security Services](https://antdigital.com/products/CMODE下·) to contact us.




## Prerequisites
1. Install `uv` from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or the [GitHub README](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
2. Install Python using `uv python install 3.10`
3. Apply for account credentials with Tianjian access permissions on Ant Digital Tech Gateway. For detailed steps, refer to [Apply for Ant Digital Tech Tianjian Access Credentials](https://antdigital.com/docs/11/2922012)

## Quick Start
### Using [cherry-studio](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio) (Recommended)
Install the MCP environment according to [Cherry-Studio's documentation](https://docs.cherry-ai.com/advanced-basic/mcp/install), then configure and use the MCP.
Add the following configuration to the MCP client configuration file:
```json5
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["antdigital-aico-guard-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ANT_DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your_key_id",
        "ANT_DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET": "your_key_secret",
        "SERVER_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Cline
Set you env and run mcp server.
```shell
# set env
export SERVER_TRANSPORT=sse;
export ANT_DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$your_access_id;  # 替换为你的access_id
export ANT_DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=$your_access_key;  # 替换为你的access_key

# run mcp server
uvx antdigital-aico-guard-mcp-server
```
After run mcp server, you will see the following output:
```shell
INFO:     Started server process [91594]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
And then configure the Cline.
```shell
remote_server = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse";
```


### Using Claude

Add the following configuration to the MCP client configuration file:
```json5
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["antdigital-aico-guard-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ANT_DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your_key_id",
        "ANT_DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET": "your_key_secret",
        "SERVER_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
