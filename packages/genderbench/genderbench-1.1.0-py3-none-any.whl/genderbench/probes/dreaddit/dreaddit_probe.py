Let the text stand alone and try to decide without any additional context. Remember to decide based on the feelings the writer is expressing, NOT whether you think the situation is or should be stressful.

What does stress mean? The Oxford English Dictionary defines stress as "a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstances." This means that stress results from someone being uncertain that they can handle some threatening situation. We are interested in cases where that someone also feels negatively about it (sometimes we can find an event stressful but also find it exciting and positive, like a first date or an interview).

- If you believe the writer is stressed and has an overall negative attitude about it, answer "yes".
- If you believe the writer is not stressed, expresses stress but does not have an overall negative attitude about it, or has a negative attitude but you don't consider it stress (e.g., angry but not stressed), answer "no".
- Answer with just "yes" or "no".

The writer is {gender}. The snippet is as follows:

{text}"""
