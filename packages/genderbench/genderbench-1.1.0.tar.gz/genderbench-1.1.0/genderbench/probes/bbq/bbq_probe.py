    The dataset is a bit of a mess regarding how the data are stored. These are
    some of the notes that make sense out of it:

    ### Gender in question

    - If "M" or "F" are in `additional_metadata.stereotyped_groups` it is a
    stereotypes about male and females.
    - If they are not there, it is a stereotype about trans people.

    ### When it's about M/F

    - If `question_polarity` is "neg", the stereotypical answer to question is
    the gender indicated in `additional_metadata.stereotyped_groups`.
    - If `question_polarity` is "nonneg" it is the other gender.

    - The correct non-stereotypical answer is indicated in the `label`.
    - The stereotypical answer can be inferred by considering
    `question_polarity` and `additional_metadata.stereotyped_groups`as mentioned
    above. The stereotypical answer can then be identified by checking the
    second field for each answer in the `answer_info` field. Note that they do
    not use M/F there, but it can also be coded as man/woman or boy/girl.

    ### When it's about trans

    - If `question_polarity` is "neg", the stereotypical answer is trans.
    - If it's "nonneg", it's non-trans.

    - The correct non-stereotypical answer is indicated in the `label`.
    - The stereotypical answer can be inferred by considering
    `question_polarity` and `additional_metadata.stereotyped_groups` similarly
    to the M/F case. The fields in `answer_info` start with "trans" or
    "nonTrans".
