ModalFold is a Python package that provides a unified interface to various protein structure prediction models, running
them efficiently on Modal's serverless infrastructure.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Serverless execution of protein folding models
- ðŸ”„ Unified API across different models
- ðŸŽ¯ Production-ready with GPU acceleration
- ðŸ“¦ Easy installation and deployment

## Installation

1. Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install modalfold
```

2. Set up Modal credentials (if you haven't already):

```bash
modal token new
```

## Quick Start

```python
from modalfold import ESMFold

# Initialize the model
model = ESMFold()

# Predict structure for a protein sequence
sequence = "MLKNVHVLVLGAGDVGSVVVRLLEK"
with model.run():
    result = model.fold([sequence])

# Access prediction results
coordinates = result.positions
confidence = result.plddt
```

## Available Models

| Model      | Status | Description                                    | Reference                                              |

## Development

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakublala/modalfold
cd modalfold
```

2. Install development dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv python install 3.12
uv sync
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

or only one test that's more verbose and shows print statements:

```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_basic.py::test_esmfold_batch -v -s
```
