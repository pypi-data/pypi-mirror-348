# webdevaccess

simple scripts using 
[domible](https://joeldodson.github.io/domible)
to help develop accessible web content.

In an effort to minimize domible's footprint,
I wanted to pull any scripts out of domible requiring dependencies not also required by domible.
Thus I created webdevaccess to host more complex scripts showing arguably more interesting usage of domible.
The scripts should all be runnable using ```pipx```.
