    """
    Performs OS-CFAR detection on a 2D data array (e.g., spectrogram) by summing
    along the frequency axis to create a 1D time series. Applies filtering,
    peak refinement, and baseline removal.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): 2D array of input data (frequency vs. time).
        guard_cells (int): Number of guard cells on each side of the CUT.
        train_cells (int): Number of training cells on each side of the CUT.
        rank_k (float): Rank (as a fraction of total training cells) for OS.
        threshold_factor (float): Scaling factor for the threshold.
        averaging (int): Window size for moving average smoothing.
        min_dist (int): Minimum distance between peaks (in samples).
        min_snr (float): Minimum SNR for peak verification.
        baseline (float): Factor for removing baseline peaks.

    Returns:
        utils.Peaks: An object containing the refined peak indices and the
                     threshold array from OS-CFAR.
