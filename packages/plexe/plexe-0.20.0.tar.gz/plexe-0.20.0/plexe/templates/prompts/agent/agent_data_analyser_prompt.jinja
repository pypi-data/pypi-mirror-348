# Task: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyze the datasets listed below to support this machine learning task:

**Task description**: "{{intent}}"

**Datasets to analyze**: {{datasets}}

Analyze each dataset thoroughly to identify patterns, relationships, and quality issues that will inform model
development. Focus on generating actionable insights that will help in building a better machine learning model.

For each dataset:
1. Access the dataset directly from the registry
2. Analyze its structure, features, quality
3. Produce your findings as a report using the register_eda_report tool

Your analysis should be comprehensive, focusing on aspects that are most relevant to the machine
learning task described above. A team of machine learning scientists and engineers will use your findings to
carry out feature engineering and develop models, so make sure to focus your report on information that is actionable
from that perspective.

You MUST ACCESS the datasets directly from the registry, as there is no other way for you to
analyze them. Use good data science judgement, and let the findings of your analysis guide your next steps.

Do NOT attempt to plot the data, as you do not have access to a display.
