# Task: Perform Deep Exploratory Data Analysis for ML Engineering

Analyze the datasets listed below to support this machine learning task:

**Task description**: "{{intent}}"

**Datasets to analyze**: {{datasets}}

Your task is to perform an ML-focused analysis that delivers DEEP, ACTIONABLE insights rather than just surface-level statistics. Model engineers will directly use your findings to drive feature engineering and algorithm selection decisions.

For each dataset:
1. Use the 'drop_null_columns' function to clean the data
2. Access the dataset directly from the registry
3. Analyze with focus on model-relevant patterns
4. Identify specific feature engineering opportunities
5. Recommend modeling strategies based on data characteristics
6. Register your report using register_eda_report

IMPORTANT: Focus your analysis on these high-value areas:
- Target variable analysis (for supervised learning) and its relationship with predictors
- Non-linear relationships that require specialized transformations
- Feature engineering opportunities (interactions, polynomial features, etc.)
- Data quality challenges with specific handling recommendations
- Feature importance and predictive potential
- Data preprocessing requirements

DO NOT waste time on extensive generic statistics that don't translate to concrete actions. Every insight should lead to a specific recommendation for data preprocessing, feature engineering, or model selection.

You MUST ACCESS the datasets directly from the registry. Use advanced statistical techniques where appropriate (correlation analysis, distribution tests, etc.) to validate your insights.

Do NOT attempt to plot the data, as you do not have access to a display. Do NOT print the entire data, as it may be too large.
