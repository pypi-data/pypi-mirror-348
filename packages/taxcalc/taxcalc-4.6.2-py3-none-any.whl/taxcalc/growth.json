One of the growth rates taken from the CBO is GDP growth. This parameter allows you to specify a real GDP growth rate, and all other rates will be modified to maintain the distance between them and GDP growth in the CBO baseline. For example, if the CBO growth rate for one year is 0.02 and the user enters 0.018 for this parameter, then 0.002 will be subtracted from every growth rate in the construction of the economic baseline, including wage and salary growth, interest income growth, dividend growth, and many others.",
