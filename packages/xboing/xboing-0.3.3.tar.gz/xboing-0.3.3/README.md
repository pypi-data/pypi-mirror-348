```

## ðŸŽ® For Players

### What is XBoing?

XBoing is a fast-paced, blockout-style arcade game where you control a paddle to bounce a ball around the play area, destroying blocks and collecting power-ups. Inspired by the classic arcade genre, XBoing features:
- 80+ challenging levels with unique layouts and increasing difficulty
- A variety of colorful block types, including indestructible, counter, bomb, sticky, and death blocks
- Special power-ups and power-downs: multiball, extra ball, paddle expand/shrink, sticky paddle, and more
- Lively sound effects and vibrant graphics
- Classic arcade-style gameplay with modern conveniences
- Addictive, skill-based action that rewards quick reflexes and strategy

Originally developed for X11 in C, XBoing was designed for speed and fun, with a focus on colorful visuals and responsive controls. This Python port faithfully recreates the original experience while adding modern compatibility.

### Installation & Playing

#### 1. Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install xboing
python -m xboing
```

#### 2. (Optional) Development Install from Source
If you want the latest development version or to contribute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmf-pobox/xboing-python.git
cd xboing-python
pip install -e .
python -m xboing
```
Or use Hatch for advanced development workflows (see below).

### Game Controls

- **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Move paddle
- **Space**: Launch ball / Pause game
- **Esc**: Quit game
- **F**: Toggle fullscreen

### Special Blocks & Power-ups

- **Multiball**: Splits your ball into multiple balls
- **Extra Ball**: Gives you an additional ball
- **Paddle Expander**: Makes your paddle larger
- **Paddle Shrinker**: Makes your paddle smaller
- **Counter Blocks**: Require multiple hits to destroy
- **Death Blocks**: End your current life when hit
- **Black Blocks**: Indestructible, bounce balls away
- **Bomb Blocks**: Explode and destroy neighboring blocks
- **Sticky Blocks**: Make balls stick to paddle

### Project Status

This Python port is under active development and is already playable. Current features include:
- âœ… Full conversion of all original XBoing assets (graphics, sounds, levels)
- âœ… Level loading system that reads and displays original level files
- âœ… Block implementation with correct behaviors and effects
- âœ… Ball physics and collision detection
- âœ… Paddle movement and control (keyboard and mouse)
- âœ… Audio system for event-driven sound effects
- âœ… Event-driven, component-based UI (score, lives, ammo, level, timer, messages)
- âœ… Paddle gun/ammo feature: ammo state, UI, collection, and sound (Phase 1 complete)
- ðŸš§ Special power-ups and effects (in progress)
- ðŸš§ Game state management and transitions (polished, but ongoing)
- ðŸš§ Score tracking and high scores (basic, more to come)
- ðŸš§ Machine gun mode and bullet logic (planned)

The game is fully playable, with most core features implemented and tested. Remaining work focuses on advanced power-ups, polish, and additional features to match and extend the original XBoing experience.

```

### Asset Management

All asset path helpers resolve to `src/xboing/assets/` and its subfolders. All images, sounds, and levels are loaded from this canonical directory inside the package. Asset conversion scripts in `scripts/` should use this path for input/output.

- Original XPM graphics â†’ PNG format (in `src/xboing/assets/images/`)
- Original AU sound files â†’ WAV format (in `src/xboing/assets/sounds/`)

Use the provided conversion scripts in `scripts/` to update or add assets as needed.

### Asset Migration Tools

```bash
# Run tests
hatch run test

# Convert XPM to PNG (for new assets)
python scripts/convert_xpm_to_png.py path/to/image.xpm output.png

# Convert AU to WAV (for new sounds)
python scripts/convert_au_to_wav.py path/to/sound.au output.wav

# Normalize all audio files in the assets directory
python scripts/normalize_audio.py

# Fix background images (formatting, transparency, etc.)
python scripts/fix_background.py

# Fix ball lost sound or related assets
python scripts/fix_balllost.py

# Search dependencies in the codebase
python scripts/dep_grep.py <search_term>
```

1. Complete implementation of all special block effects
2. High score system
3. Game state management and transitions
4. Enhanced visual effects
5. Additional sound effects
6. Level editor

### Testing & Quality

- All major UI components (score, lives, level, timer, message window) are event-driven, component-based, and have dedicated unit tests.
- The test suite includes both unit and integration tests, covering game logic, event-driven UI updates, and core systems.
- Tests are run before and after each major change to ensure stability and catch regressions early.
- Type hints and docstrings are used throughout for clarity and static analysis.
- Logging is used for warnings and errors (no print statements in production code).
- The codebase is designed for maintainability, extensibility, and testability, following modern Python best practices.
