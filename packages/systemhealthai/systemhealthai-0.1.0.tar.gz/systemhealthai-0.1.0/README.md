### AI SRE for system health triaging

As an SRE, Cloud engineer, you may have to constantly look at logs, metrics, traces to troubleshoot and triage issues to figure out why particular systems may be having issues. SystemHealthAI ( SHAI ) is an AI agent which will act as an AI SRE, to look at different data sources like prometheus, elasticsearch, cloudwatch, splunk and help triage issues and provide insights into why the system or systems might be acting up.

### Show Your Support ‚≠ê  
If you find SHAI useful, please consider giving it a **STAR** ! ‚≠ê  


### Quick start 

### Pre-Reqs

- Install `uv` to run mcp servers
- OpenAI Api Key
- Datasource url for prometheus have a prometheus url ready to use
- pip or poetry  

#### Using pip 

```
pip install systemhealthai

```

#### From Source using poetry

```
git clone git@github.com:ajinkyakadam/systemhealthai.git
cd systemhealthai
poetry install -e . 
```

### Setup 


### Using SHAI

```
shai nodeA --model "openai:o4-mini"
```

The above command instructs shai to use the `o4-mini` model and triage the nodeA server. 
Please replace the nodeA with an actual hostname that you would like to find information for.
