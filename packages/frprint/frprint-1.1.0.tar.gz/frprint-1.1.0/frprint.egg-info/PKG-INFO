# Introducing "rprint"!

If we want to repeat using "print()" before,<br>
We should use "for()" or spam "print()".<br>
But now! we can use "rprint()"!

## how to use

It is very easy to use.<br>
Just type rprint(), and put two variables in the "rprint()".<br>
There's a 2 Type of rprint must need.<br>
rprint() needs "text" and "int".<br>
for an example,<br>
&nbsp; rprint("Hello python!",4)<br>
&nbsp; It is same with...<br>
```
for i in range(4) :
    print("Hello python!")
```
Is same with,<br>
```
rprint("Hello python!")
```
Yup. It goes like rprint(text,int,boolean(optional,Default value is True) )
If you write rprint like this...
```
rprint("Hello python!",4,False)
```
It goes like...
```
for i in range(4) :
    print("Hello word!", end=" ")
```

And this is all to use rprint()!<br>
Ps.<br>
you can also print variables.()
