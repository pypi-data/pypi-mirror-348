# TOMLify

A TOML utility tool to simplify working with toml configuration files.  This project was inspired by the tomlkit tool which was really helpful for building a number of my own utilities, but didn't have some apis that I was hoping for.  

... One thing led to another and I started spinning up my own parser.
