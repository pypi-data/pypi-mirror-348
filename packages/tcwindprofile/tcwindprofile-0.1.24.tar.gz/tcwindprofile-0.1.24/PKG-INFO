# TCWindProfile

A package that creates fast and robust radial profiles of the tropical cyclone rotating wind and pressure from inputs Vmax, R34kt, and latitude. Based on the latest observationally-validated science on the structure of the wind field and pressure.

- Generate complete wind profile: merge inner and outer

- Generate pressure profile that matches Pmin: same ref as previous

Currently, this code uses a quadratic profile inside the eye (r<Rmax), a modified‐Rankine vortex between Rmax and R34kt (inner model), and the E04 model beyond R34kt. It is very similar to the full physics-based wind profile model of Chavas et al. (2015) ([code here](http://doi.org/10.4231/CZ4P-D448)), but is simpler and much faster, and also includes a more reasonable eye model.

The model starts from the radius of 34kt, which is the most robust measure of size we have: it has long been routinely-estimated operationally; it is at a low enough wind speed to be accurately estimated by satellites over the ocean (higher confidence in data); and it is less noisy because it is typically outside the convective inner-core of the storm. The model then encodes the latest science to estimate 1) Rmax from R34kt (+ Vmax, latitude), 2) the radius of vanishing wind R0 from R34kt (+ latitude, an environmental constant), and 3) the minimum pressure Pmin from Vmax, R34kt, latitude, translation speed, and environmental pressure. Hence, it is very firmly grounded in the known physics of the tropical cyclone wind field while also matching the input data. It is also guaranteed to be very well‐behaved for basically any input parameter combination.
