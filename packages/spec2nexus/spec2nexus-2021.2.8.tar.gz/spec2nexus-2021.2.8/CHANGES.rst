Breaking Changes
------------------------------------

The plugin system was rebuilt to make it easier to write and load plugins,
especially custom, user-provided plugins.

New Features and/or Enhancements
------------------------------------

Added another way to access scans, using Python's slicing interface.
See the *Slice Parameters* section for more details and examples.

Add new diffractometer configuration reports:

* ``str(scan.diffractometer)``:  minimal view of ``scan``
* ``scan.diffractometer.print_brief(scan)`` : content similar to SPEC's ``wh``
* ``scan.diffractometer.print_all(scan)`` : content similar to SPEC's ``pa``

Documentation reorganized and using new Furo theme.

New documentation of the NeXus file structure.

Fixes
------------------------------------

* ``eznx``: needs to return text as ``str`` (not ``bytes``).
* ``twoc``: diffractometer geometry has 2-D lattice and reflection(s)

Maintenance
------------------------------------

* Optimize initial load times for data files.
* Code tests now use real examples of non-zero MCA data using files with both
  single and multiple MCA detectors.
* Tests of code using Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10
* All unit test code now in-source using ``pytest``
* Code is now compliant with `PEP8 <https://pep8.org/>`_ (Python code style guide).
* Increase number of unit tests to improve code coverage (now ~95%).

	see [release notes](https://github.com/prjemian/spec2nexus/wiki/releasenotes__2-1-0)

	It takes a couple steps to upgrade an existing conda installation from version 2017.nnnn to newer version 2.1.0

	- add a declaration of `spec2nexus < 2000` in the `conda-meta/pinned` file in the conda environment
	- `conda update -c prjemian spec2nexus` (should change to 2.1.0)

	It may still be necessary to uninstall and reinstall spec2nexus to effect an update:

		conda uninstall -y spec2nexus
		conda install -c prjemian spec2nexus
