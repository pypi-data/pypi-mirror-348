/// Finds all matches of a regular expression in a given text and calls the
/// provided callback with the start and length of each match.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function is marked as `unsafe` because it dereferences the given
/// `pattern` and `text` pointers. The caller must ensure that these pointers
/// are valid and point to zero-terminated strings. The function will return
/// immediately if the pointers are null or if the callback is null.
///
/// The callback is called once for each match of the regular expression in
/// the given text. The callback is passed the start and length of the match
/// as arguments. The callback should not take ownership of the strings;
/// instead, it should copy the relevant parts of the strings if necessary.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// If the regular expression is invalid, the function will return immediately
/// without calling the callback.
///
/// If the callback returns an error, the function will return immediately
/// without calling the callback again.
