# MCP Yahoo Finance

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server for Yahoo Finance interaction. This server provides tools to get pricing, company information and more.

> Please note that `mcp-yahoo-finance` is currently in early development. The functionality and available tools are subject to change and expansion as I continue to develop and improve the server.

## Installation

You don't need to manually install `mcp-yahoo-finance` if you use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). We'll use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run `mcp-yahoo-finance`.

I would recommend using this method if you simply want to use the MCP server.

### Using pip

Using `pip`.

```sh
pip install mcp-yahoo-finance
```

### Using Git

You can also install the package after cloning the repository to your machine.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:maxscheijen/mcp-yahoo-finance.git
cd mcp-yahoo-finance
uv sync
```

    }
