## üì¶ Installation

Pyharp can be installed on either a Linux distribution or on MacOS. Open a Linux or Mac terminal,
you can clone this repo using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/chengcli/pyharp
```
This will copy all source files into your local computer. You will need to install a few
system libraries before installing pyharp. All following instructions are executed under
the `pyharp/` directory, which is referred to as the `root`.

---

### üß™ System Requirements:
- Python 3.9+
- Linux or macOS
- netCDF
- use python virtual environment for isolation

If you are using `MacOS`, you may need to install `hdf5` and `netCDF` libraries:
```bash
brew install netcdf
```

If you are using `RedHat`, you may need to install `hdf5` and `netCDF` libraries:
```bash
sudo yum install netcdf
```

To install the required python libraries, you can use the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Build and test
After you completed the installation steps, you can build the pyharp library.
The easiest way is to build it in-place, meaning that the build (binary files) are
located under `root`. To do so, make a new directory named `build`
```
mkdir build
```
All build files will be generated and placed under this directory. It is completely safe
to delete the whole directory if you want another build. `cd` to build and `cmake`

```
cd build
cmake ..
```
This command tells the cmake command to look for `CMakeFiles.txt` in the parent directory,
and start configuring the compile environment. Then compile the code by
```
make -j4
```
This comman will use 4 cores to compile the code in parallel. Once complete, all executable
files will be placed in `build/bin`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Install locally (dev mode)
The python library can be installed by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
