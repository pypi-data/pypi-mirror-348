    """Wait for resource to be available

    This function can be used by other plugins to ensure that
    a resource is available for processing.

    There multiple ways for data to become available:

    1. The ckanext-dcor_depot plugin imports data by touching
       dummy files and then sym-linking to data on disk. Here
       we just check that the file is not a dummy file anymore.
    2. Legacy uploads via nginx/uwsgi directly into CKAN and onto
       the local block storage worked the same way. We have to wait
       for the dummy file to be replaced.
    3. The new (2024) way of uploading data is via pre-signed URLs
       to an S3 instance. Here, we have to make sure that the
       upload is complete and the file exists. If this is the case,
       then uploads should have already completed when this function
       is called, so we only check for the existence of the resource
       in ckan and whether the `s3_available` attribute is defined.
