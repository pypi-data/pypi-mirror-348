Quickstart

the library provides different scopes of information
Father Objects

a set of classes that represent biblical fathers, such as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

import biblicaljesus_humans

abraham = humans.Abraham()
print(abraham.**dict**)

List of Humans

on a broader scope, the library traces different categories of humans, such as fathers, mothers and children.

import humans

all_mothers = humans.mothers
print(all_mothers)
