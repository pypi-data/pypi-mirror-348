   .. code-block:: shell

       $ conda activate ptychodus
       $ ptychodus -h

       usage: ptychodus [-h] [-b {reconstruct,train}] [-f FILE_PREFIX] [-s SETTINGS_FILE] [-v] [-w OUTPUT_DIR]

       ptychodus is a ptychography analysis application

       options:
         -h, --help            show this help message and exit
         -b {reconstruct,train}, --batch {reconstruct,train}
                               run action non-interactively
         -f FILE_PREFIX, --file-prefix FILE_PREFIX
                               replace file path prefix in settings
