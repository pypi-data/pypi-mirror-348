# Brevo MCP for Claude

This MCP (Model Control Panel) provides Claude with the ability to interact with the [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) marketing platform API. Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) is an all-in-one digital marketing platform that offers email marketing, SMS marketing, chat, CRM, and automation tools.

With this MCP, Claude can:
- Manage contacts and contact lists
- Create and manage email campaigns
- Send transactional emails
- Manage email templates
- Track email engagement
- Send SMS messages
- Access analytics data

## Prerequisites

To use this MCP, you need:

1. UV installed on your system (if you don't have it, [install UV here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))
2. A Brevo account and API key (get this from your Brevo account settings)

Set the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export BREVO_API_KEY="your-brevo-api-key-here"
```

## Claude Configuration

To configure Claude to use this MCP, add it to your project settings. No local installation needed - just configure Claude to use `uvx mcp-brevo` directly:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "brevo",
      "command": "uvx mcp-brevo",
      "description": "Provides access to Brevo marketing platform API for contact management, email campaigns, and transactional emails"
    }
  ]
}
```

That's it! When Claude uses the Brevo MCP, UV will automatically fetch the package and its dependencies and run it directly.
